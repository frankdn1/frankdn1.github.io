# Chapter Dates Validation Report

## Analysis Summary

The chapter date analysis was performed on 2 sample chapters using both filename patterns and LLM content analysis.

### Key Findings:
- Both chapters were successfully analyzed
- The LLM provided estimated years with confidence scores
- Validation status shows consistency between filename patterns and content analysis

## Detailed Results

| Chapter | Title | Filename Year | LLM Year | Confidence | Validation Status |
|---------|-------|---------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | My Earlier Years that I Can Remember | unknown | 1955 | 0.8 | Consistent |
| 2 | Hunting and Fishing in The Yukon | unknown | 1965 | 0.9 | Consistent |

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding year information to filenames where possible
2. Review low-confidence analyses (confidence < 0.5)
3. Expand analysis to remaining chapters
