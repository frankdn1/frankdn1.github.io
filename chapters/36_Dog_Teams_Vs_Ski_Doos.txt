Most people are totally wrong about the reliability of dogs versus Ski-Doos. I never had a Ski-Doo run away and keep ahead of me if I fell off like a dog team had the dirty habit of doing. If you fell off the back of the sled or while running, you had a 20-foot rope with several big knots always dragging behind. When you were running, you had to keep getting off the back of the "lazy back" and jog to avoid freezing. You couldn’t stand on the back of the sled in a 15-20 mph wind when it was 20-30 degrees below zero, as you’d freeze to death. You only did this on a hard-packed trail; otherwise, you held the rope when running on a poorly broken trail. Often, you snowshoed to break the trail for the dogs, and then you had no trouble keeping warm. I still have my homemade trail snowshoes—they’re six feet long and seven inches wide.

The dogs learned left and right (haw and gee), which was reinforced by throwing a small chain (part of what you used to tie them out at night or when you were away from the team). You threw it out on the left if you wanted them to take the trail to the right. The word for "go" was simple: "Hut, hut, hut!" reinforced with the snap of a whip. If you missed the tug rope and fell, no matter how loud you hollered for them to stop—"Whoa, you SOB, whoa!"—they were smart enough to keep just ahead of you. They would sooner pull a sled without your weight.

It was a pretty critical moment because your food, shelter, and rifle were on the sled, and it carried a lot more significance when you were 50 miles from home. Your only hope sometimes was that they’d get tangled on the trail or startle a rabbit, moose, caribou, or deer, and the toboggan would get ensnared in the trees. Several times, I’ve had a five-mile or more run, with them just going fast enough to stay ahead of me.

One reason the RCMP got good mileage out of our dogs was that we cooked them a hot meal at the end of the day, so they went to bed with a belly full of warm food. Most of the Natives got 10-20 miles a day, while we covered 30-50, depending on trail conditions. It bothered me that the dogs had their supper prepared and fed before I could eat, but it shortened the time on the trail since they were cared for first.

I put memo after memo advocating that the RCMP get rid of the dogs and switch to snow machines. You had to feed the dogs year-round, and during the summer, you had to carry water to them every single day. The snow machine, on the other hand, could be put away for the summer. The dog food was never fully supplied for the 10 or 15 dogs we maintained. The RCMP had two breeding stations in the North: one at Arctic Red River and the other at Coppermine. They expected members to feed the dogs from local “land food,” like seals or fish since the RCMP supplied very little for them.

Having been the biggest advocate for switching to Ski-Doos, Ottawa eventually approved giving the dogs and equipment away to local trappers and hunters in Fort McPherson. They sent a Bombardier Ski-Doo and a big Evinrude machine with steel cleats across the tracks, reverse gear, and a weight double that of a Ski-Doo. We had a lot of open ice in the river and creeks in the area, and the Evinrude wouldn’t even pull itself up the riffles in the creeks. Most trails had portages with 10-foot banks out of the creeks, and you had to winch the machine up because it was too heavy to make a run to the top. Needless to say, the Ski-Doo won hands down.

When I was transferred from Fort McPherson to Coppermine, the Corporal ahead of us knew he was being transferred and didn’t do any sealing or fish gathering for the dogs. The Corporal, of course, took the day shift, and I took the night shift. We set six nets in the outflow of the Coppermine River and pulled the nets about every hour for two weeks. We double-iced them and hauled the fish to the dog food-insulated building. When we had several tons of fish stored away, we went to the office after picking up the mail. The first envelope we opened contained instructions to disperse the dogs and harnesses to the local trappers and hunters as two Ski-Doos were being shipped from Yellowknife.

I had a double-tracked Ski-Doo "Alpine" model of my own when I was at Watson Lake, and it was a go-anywhere machine in winter, great for climbing slopes in the mountains. I only had one mishap with it. I was going around the building with the idea that I could load it onto the trailer without partially lifting the heavy machine. I had backed the trailer into a snowbank at the edge of the driveway. The double-track Ski-Doo had a single ski in front and was quite broad to accommodate the double tracks. There was a power pole with a support cable near the driveway, and the snow was about three feet deep.

I was standing on the side panels, going full tilt, and swung wide to align with the trailer. I hadn’t considered that the cable angled down into the snow. Suddenly, the machine stopped immediately or even backed up, and I was airborne at about 20 mph, flying through the windshield. I landed on my back in the driveway, with the remains of the windshield in my parka pockets and the wind knocked out of me. I thought I had given the cable plenty of space, as I was to the right of where it went into the snow, but I hadn’t accounted for the downward angle. The machine had caught the right side of the frame in front. Other than a mark on the front bumper, it wasn’t damaged. My only injury was to my dignity in front of the onlookers.

I guess they wanted to get back at me for insisting on getting rid of the dogs. The first winter I was at Fort McPherson, they sent us two different machines: one Ski-Doo that weighed about 450 pounds and another 800-pound Evinrude, complete with electric start, twin cylinders, reverse gear, and metal bars across the tracks. On glaciered areas of creeks, we had to tow the Evinrude across smooth ice because it couldn’t pull itself, let alone a loaded toboggan, up any incline. If it buried itself in deep snow, the reverse only dug a deeper hole. That massive weight made it impossible to lift out of any predicament. So, we always had to carry a snow shovel, using it every time the machine floundered in the deep snow.

In the western Arctic, the snow never formed a crust because it never warmed enough to melt the surface. It remained light and fluffy until it was packed on the trails. In the central Arctic, however, the wind packed the snow like concrete into uneven drifts, making for an uncomfortable ride and limiting the speed you could travel. Many trails out in the bush followed rivers and creeks, and there were always portages with 20-30-foot banks you had to climb. It was impossible to get enough momentum with the heavy machine to scale the steep banks.

I suppose you can guess which machine I recommended for the Force to buy. The Ski-Doo, with its simple single-cylinder Rotax engine, was easy to maintain. All you had to do was remove the belt, gas line, wiring, springs, and four nuts to take out the engine, and you could carry it into the tent for servicing. On long trips, we’d service the engine daily by "de-carboning" the piston and cylinder head because the oil-gas fuel mixture of that era built up carbon, slowing engine RPM and performance. The other machine took a day to remove the engine and required an additional tent and stove to work on it. On top of that, it was too wide to fit through the doors of the workshop back home. The bearings on every wheel supporting the track needed constant greasing, or they’d fail.

The greatest change when using a snow machine in cold weather was the need for more layers of clothing. You couldn’t rely on physical exertion to stay warm. Wind pants, down-filled parkas, gauntlets, mukluks—you had to be prepared to keep warm with minimal movement.

In all honesty, I have to admit one Ski-Doo did get away fromme once. It brings to mind an event where I was helping the boys at Coppermine assemble and service their Ski-Doos. Two machines came in that were scheduled for Baker Lake. I was asked to go there to assemble them, as the aircraft had a couple of hours of flight time left and would return to Coppermine. We got one assembled, and I told the guy not to start it until we had the box underneath the frame at the back to align the track.

It was mid-winter, and we were assembling the Ski-Doos in the heated garage. We pushed one outside, and while I lifted the back, my partner placed the box underneath. He put his knee on the seat and started the engine. Unfortunately, when he pulled on the throttle, the cable leading to the carburetor stuck, causing the engine to rev at full throttle. The cable had frozen from condensation—it had been in the warmth of the aircraft and then in the garage, but when we moved it outside into the -30°F temperature, it froze.

When he shifted his weight on one of the side panels to get off, the machine slid off the box and immediately took off across the yard, heading down Baker Lake at full speed. We could see the red taillight bouncing over the drifts until it disappeared out of sight.

Panic set in, and we rushed to get the second machine ready so we could chase the runaway. The first Ski-Doo didn’t have a full tank of gas, so we figured it would stop before reaching the trees on the south end of the lake. We got the second one outside and began aligning the track. We kept the hood up to manually adjust the throttle in case it got stuck again. My partner was putting on his cold-weather gear, preparing to head out and look for the lost machine.

Just as he was ready, we saw a headlight a couple of miles away, bobbing and weaving over the drifts, coming toward us. As it got closer, we realized it was the same Ski-Doo—without a driver. Somehow, it had turned around on its own and was heading back toward us. Amazingly, it made its way to within 10 feet of where it had taken off before crashing partway through the garage wall and coming to rest, idling.

It was astonishing how the machine had managed to turn around and return almost to its starting point. The only damage was a bent bumper, slightly bent skis, and a few scratches on the cowling. We straightened the skis, checked the throttle to make sure it didn’t stick, and everything was good to go. By the time the plane arrived back, both Ski-Doos were running fine, and the crew was already enjoying rides around the settlement.

The longest trip I ever made on a Ski-Doo was 285 miles one way, from Coppermine to a small lake near Contwoyto Lake. We used snow machines daily to respond to complaints, patrol the settlement, and sometimes search for overdue hunters, trappers, and prospectors. After I left the North and was stationed in Grande Prairie, my neighbor invited me to try out his new Ski-Doo. He couldn’t understand why I wasn’t eager to ride—after spending so much time in the North, the novelty had worn off.

In the North, I had installed kill switches on our machines—a simple loop around your mitten attached to a cotter pin that connected to the ignition. If your left hand left the handlebar or the cotter pin was pulled, the machine would stop immediately. This was helpful when transporting drunk individuals from the upper end of the settlement—if you had to get off the machine to deal with them, it would automatically stop. It also served as an anti-theft measure. Even if someone found the key in the ignition, without the correct cotter pin, the machine wouldn’t start. And if you fell off, the Ski-Doo wouldn’t get far before stopping and waiting for you.

In the Western Arctic, many trails had vertical climbs off riverbanks or lake shores. You’d often need to bail off and let the machine, free of your weight, use its momentum to make the climb. You’d first make a few passes to ensure your bail-off point wasn’t crusted over or drifted with snow. Once the machine made it to the top, we would drop the toboggan, use a sturdy rope, and pull the loaded sled up the incline.

The local Natives appreciated when we patrolled using snow machines because we would clear branches and fallen trees along the trails. While they would usually crouch behind the "lazy back" of their sleds and hope for the best, this often led to injuries. A sled ahead would break off a branch, leaving a sharp point, and the next person in line would get stabbed by it. We made aneffort to clear the trails, not just for our protection but to prevent further injury and preserve our fragile windshields, which were easily damaged in the extreme cold. Though it took time and effort, clearing the trail paid off on return trips and lasted for several years.
