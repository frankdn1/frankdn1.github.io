With the thought of long-distance planning two years later, I had decided that our daughter would be going into Kindergarten in the fall, and I had witnessed how the local native kids had brutally abused other member’s children and did not want Sherry subjected to the black eyes and bruises, I applied for a transfer out of the North and wished to be posted to Alberta.It got approved, and we had been chosen to work in Grande Prairie, Alberta, on the 1st of July, 1971.

We took a flight out with the Police aircraft in May of 1971 for a “House Hunting Trip,”and there was only one house that was available for rent in all of Grande Prairie as it was really booming with the newly discovered oil field in the area. A meteorite had hit the roof, and it had not been repaired. It would only be rented if I agreed to pay to fix the roof, and most of the ceilings had to be replaced because of water damage.We found the best contractor in the community, picked out the house plan, and signed the papers to have them have the house ready for our occupancy by the last of July when we planned to be there to go to work. 

Back in Coppermine, I was working out plans to move my aircraft from there to our new home in Grande Prairie, and I checked with the pilots on the scheduled flight, and it appeared that I would have a few days of good weather over most of the North as well as Alberta as summer weather had arrived.I took off for the first 371 miles to Yellowknife.A member met me at the airport and he wondered if he could talk me into taking him over to Hay River to attend a member’s going away party that he had been stationed with for two years.I had planned on going around the Great Slave Lake instead of across the lake, but he said he would pay for gas as he could not drive there in time to attend the party, and he could get the “Buffalo Express” back to Yellowknife.I fueled up the aircraft and filed a revised flight plan, and we headed across the Great Bear Lake for Hay River. We continued climbing until we could make out the far shore of the lake, and it surprised me to see so much ice still on the lake.The distance from Yellowknife to Hay River is just 123 miles, and by road, it is 424 km.

 We landed and were met at the aircraft by members that I had been stationed with while I was in the Yukon, and I was invited to the party. I fueled the aircraft and closed my flight plan, and we went into Hay River, had supper, and went to the function.They had bought out what they had left at the Liquor Store in Hay River, and all they had was Meteus Rose’ sparkling wine.All it did for me was give me a horrible headache.I got a ride out to the airport in the morning and filed a flight plan for a stop in High Level, some 214 miles away, for fuel, and then my final destination would be Grande Prairie, another 239 miles further south.It was a smooth, easy flight because you really did not have to navigate; you just followed the dust cloud over the Mackenzie Highway.

I tried flying at 10,000 feet, but the effects of the Meteus returned, and I got cleared down to 5,000 feet before the effects of the alcohol were noticeable and flew around the heavy dust clouds that drifted off the highway.I landed at High Level, fueled up, and cut across the country headed for Grande Prairie. The number of roads and every field represented a nice, safe landing field, so it was a very relaxed flight.You did not have to be constantly aware of a possible landing site if the engine quit.

 I landed at Grande Prairie and tied down the aircraft and closed my flight plan. The Police Plane was on the prisoner escort patrol and had a stop in Peace River to drop the prisoners off for the Peace River Correctional Institute. And was returning to pick up prisoners at High Level, and six hours later, I was back in High Level.The members made arrangements that they would meet with the Highway Patrol out of Yellowknife, and I could act as an escort for a prisoner that was being returned to Yellowknife that they had picked up on a warrant.I took the scheduled flight back to Coppermine in the morning.

A week later, the Twin OtterPolice plane was picking us up for our transfer to Grande Prairie and loaded up our personal effects in the trunks that I had made.It was offloaded in Yellowknife, and I checked with Ottawa as I was concerned about the fact that they were planning on shipping it from Yellowknife to Grande Prairie by transport trucks. They assured me that the Government insurance would cover it, and I need not put insurance on our effects for theft or damage.Our family and I went by Commercial Airlines to Grande Prairie.When we arrived, we went to see the house we had arranged to be built. It was the same empty lot that we had chosen in May, and they had not been allowed to even dig the basement out until they could get compaction on the street in the crescent. It has rained for the past two months.The contractor said they would supply us with accommodation in a duplex that they rented until our house was ready to move into.As noted, everything was supplied in the North, and we went about buying everything to furnish our new house in this apartment. We needed all the appliances, furniture, beds, and our wardrobe for the hot summer.We bought a pickup and an Alaskan camper.

When we got our personal effects delivered from Transport Company we found most of it was ruined.They had hauled it over the Mackenzie highway in a trailer without air ride suspension and most of the Eskimo carvings that we had carefully packed, so a great number of them had chaffed the blankets, so they were ruined.I had a skill saw and gig saw in a metal box and it had been shaken so much that they were shaken all apart in the box.The small Hoover washing machine had the wheels and frame broken and up inside the damaged metal cabinet.

Ottawa advised me that I would have to have the damage appraised, and our personal clothing sheets and blankets would have to be weighed.When I got that notice, I became very suspicious of how the claim was going to be settled.I took the Eskimo carvings to Edmonton and had to pay $75.00 for the appraisal, which valued them at almost $10,000.00.I sent copies of the receipts for the new skill saw and gig saw that I replaced.Ottawa came back with the claim that they insurance company would only pay me three cents a pound, and it totaled $29.00 that I received for that transfer.
