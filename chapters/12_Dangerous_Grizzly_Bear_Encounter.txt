The Forestry and Game Warden received a call mid-winter from the manager of the Socony-Mobil Oil drilling camp, reporting trouble with a grizzly bear in the Eagle Plains area. The bear had been moving from one camp to another, eating out of their garbage dumps, and had threatened several workers. They were concerned the bear might kill someone if not dealt with. The manager suspected the bear was old and possibly sick since it should have been hibernating months earlier.

Eagle Plains is located about 300 miles northeast of Dawson City and is accessible by driving up the Dempster Highway. From there, the oil company roads stretched north, crossing the Eagle River and following seismic lines, which had been graded almost straight north from the Chapman Lake turnoff, which was the end of the Dempster Highway at that time. The relatively flat area of the Eagle Plains is bordered by the Ogilvie Mountain range to the west and the Richardson Mountains to the east, paralleling the Mackenzie River. The roads were perfectly straight and regularly cleared of several feet of snow to allow camps and drilling rigs to be moved from one location to another. The company had 35 oil rigs drilling shallow wells to assess the extent of the oil and gas deposits throughout Eagle Plains.

We loaded up the four-wheel-drive pickup truck with plenty of fuel, food, our “Arctic Five Star” sleeping bags, and layers of clothing. It was -65°F when we left Dawson City. Upon reaching the first camp, we learned the road had been closed to truck traffic due to concerns that the drill stems might break in such low temperatures. They gave us a map and the locations of their drill rig sites close to the main road so they could monitor our progress. Every camp had radio contact, which provided some assurance. The main road was straight for miles, smoothly graded over the permafrost, with high snowbanks on either side. When we descended into the Eagle River valley, the windshield began frosting up as the temperature dropped even further. Crossing the ice bridge, the cold intensified. Once we climbed out of the valley, the frost on the windshield cleared slightly. My partner remarked that he had insulated the truck engine to ensure some warmth in the cab despite the extreme cold.

We finally arrived at the camp where the grizzly had been harassing the workers and were invited in for supper. Earlier that day, the cook had taken two buckets of garbage out, and as he stepped onto the four-by-eight-foot deck, the door closed behind him. Standing directly off the step was the grizzly bear. The cook, dressed only in his whites and a hat, found himself face-to-face with the six-foot-tall bear. He said the bear’s breath smelled awful. As the bear growled and snarled, the cook slowly lowered the buckets of scraps and inched back inside, frostbitten on his forearms and ears from the brief exposure to the cold.

Another worker told us how he had been filling the water tanks behind the stove. As he went to hang the hose to drain for the next fill-up, it became stuck. When he went to free it, he saw that the grizzly had the other end of the forty-foot hose in its teeth. The man immediately dropped the hose, ran to the rig, and climbed the ladder, freezing his hands on the rungs as he watched the bear return to the garbage dump. The entire scene was illuminated by the rig’s lights.

My partner admitted that he had brought me along to deal with the bear, as I had a lot of experience with bears. He wasn’t going to hold the flashlight for me either—he was more than happy to let me take the lead.

During the summer, when oil company employees had gathered in Dawson City for winter operations, six liquor outlets, including the liquor store and four bars with live entertainment, contributed to a lot of drinking. The local Natives were catching salmon and curing them, but the chaos from the drinking led to many salmon fires being neglected. The fish rotted, and the smell attracted every grizzly and black bear to town. Over a two-week period, I shot four black bears and five grizzlies. The locals, armed with .30-30 rifles, would aggravate the bears, and I would be called in to finish the job. On one occasion, a man sent his dog team after a grizzly, only for the bear to dismember the dogs. It wasn’t hard to find the bear afterward; the scene was horrific.

That night at camp, I brought my rifle into the cook shack to warm up. I convinced one of the workers to come outside and shine a light over the garbage pit, about 100 feet from the kitchen steps. A trench, ten feet deep, had been dug in the permafrost for waste, and a berm of dirt had been piled at one end. The grizzly, unhappy with our presence, growled from the bottom of the trench. I waited for a clean shot as the bear paced, but just as it stood up, roaring, the light went out. The worker holding it had rushed back inside, trying to scrape ice from the window so he could shine the light from there. When that failed, I taped the flashlight to my rifle and went back out cautiously.

I called out, and the bear responded with growls from the garbage pit. When it finally climbed the berm, moving its head from side to side, I aimed and fired. The muzzle flash was bright, and when the smoke cleared, the bear was gone. I reloaded and cautiously approached. The bear roared and charged up the slope, but I fired again, hitting it mid-air. The bear crashed to the ground about 30 feet away and fled into the scrub spruce trees. I was confident I had hit it with a fatal shot, so I decided to let it stiffen up and die while we ate supper.

Throughout the meal, the workers regaled me with their tales of hunting squirrels and raccoons. Afterward, I asked for volunteers to help me check on the bear. Unsurprisingly, no one volunteered. So, I taped a flashlight to a hockey stick, thinking the bear would go for the light and not the person. I followed the bear's tracks along a seismic line, and about 300 yards in, they slowed to a walk. I found the bear lying dead in the snow. It had died back at the garbage pit and would have saved me the trouble of listening to all those hunting stories if it had known.

We retrieved a Nodwell-tracked vehicle with gin poles to hoist the 12-foot bear and took pictures. We loaded the bear into the Forestry pickup and headed home, checking in with the rig camps along the way. Some sections of the road ran straight for 50 or 60 miles, and we decided to stop at one camp before crossing the Eagle River, as we expected the valley would be bitterly cold.

As we approached the turnoff near the Eagle River, the steering wheel wouldn’t turn, and the truck veered into a snowbank, stalling. The battery was dead, and attempts to start it were futile. We resigned ourselves to waiting in the back with our sleeping bags, but the bear’s frozen body transferred the cold directly into the truck bed. We used the shovel to carve out tunnels in the snowbank, creating small caves where we could shelter.

On the third day, after I had run out of food, the situation became more anxious. Our tunnels were icing up, and the snow insulation was losing its effectiveness. My partner mentioned he heard something. I strained to listen and heard a faint clicking sound. I dug through the snow and peered out to see a herd of caribou blocking the road. I grabbed my rifle, lined up a shot, and fired—but had forgotten to chamber a round. Quietly, I reloaded, aimed again, and pulled the trigger. The deafening blast from inside the tunnel kicked back hard, but there was no caribou lying in the road. Instead, I saw a small puff of steam about 50 feet away. The extreme cold had shrunk the barrel, causing the bullet to fall short. I kept that bullet as a souvenir of the incident.

About five hours later, a truck arrived and pulled us out. They mentioned they had been waiting for the temperature to rise to -60°F, per company policy. We were fed at the next camp before heading back to Dawson City. Upon skinning the bear, I found that my first shot had pierced between the ribs, gone through both chambers of the heart, and lodged against a rib on the other side. The second shot had hit the left hind leg and stopped in the chest cavity. The Socony-Mobil manager had the bear made into a full-head mount rug.

My partner later reflected that the temperature in the Eagle River valley had likely been between -70°F and -75°F, as the mercury in the rearview mirror thermometer had sunk entirely into the bulb. I visited the Socony-Mobil office and saw hundreds of oil samples. They said it took about a week to drill a well, and they had 35 rigs drilling for two months. The deepest well, known as "Molar," produced sweet crude, with oil samples ranging from dark brown to reddish amber. The manager believed it was one of the most extensive oil-bearing fields ever discovered. However, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Berger Inquiry stopped the Mackenzie River pipeline due to environmental concerns and Indigenous land claims. Despite proposals from both Canada and the U.S. for pipelines connecting the Beaufort Sea and Prudhoe Bay to the southern markets, none were ever approved, even after 56 years.
