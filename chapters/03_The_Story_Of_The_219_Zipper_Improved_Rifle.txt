Before I joined the force, I had an idea that I was going to become a gunsmith as I did all of my own re-leading for five different centerfire calibre rifles and attended a couple “gun smithing” courses and passedthe courses with honours.I was building up a collection of Winchester rifles of one of every calibre that they made a rifle for.I was working on refurbishing a 45-90 Winchester with a “High–Wall” action, and I was going to have the barrel “re-browned,” not “re-blued,”which is the normal finish to prevent rusting.I have since resold that entire collection of Winchester rifles.I had the barrel off the action as it was a high polished, shiny, hardened steeled action.About that time,the ”.218 Bee” bolt action “varmitter” fore-stock had cracked and broken, and I was going to replace that portion.I had the barrel off the “varmiter” to be able to more easily and better fit the wood to the barrel.I tried the barrel to see if it fit into the high-wall action and found that it was the same thread pattern, so the idea of being able to build up a real “varmiter” took over. 

After the Douglas “Supreme” heavy barrel was re-chambered tothe .219 Zipper, I then put a new face of the action with a smaller firing pin hole and smaller firing pin to help with pressure buildup and disfigurement of the primers with the big firing pin of the .405. Then I ran into a problem that there wasabsolutely no .219 ammunition available anywhere. To overcome this problem, I had it re-chambered again to “.219 Zipper Improved.”With that lengthening of the chamber,it allowed for about six more grains of powder than the 30.30 cartridge had originally.Then I could “neck–down” .30-30 cartridges andfound that after they were “fire formed,” they held six more grains of powder than the original 30-30 shape,which meant more “oomph” behind the 85-grain hollow point bullet.I have had it choreographed at just under 4,000 feet per second.So I can assure you there is no moss growing on the back of that bullet when I touch oneoff.

With about six more grains of powder, push the 85-grain hollow point bullet;if you hit a blade of grass, it upsets the path of the bullet seriously.At three hundred yards, I have several targets that are clover leaves with ten rounds.I take great patience in reloading the bullets so they perform really well.I weigh even the cases to get near matching weight.I have done a lot of “varmiting” for crows and groundhogs back in Ontario, and I have done a lot of competitive shooting.I had the idea that I could get every groundhog in a 100-acre field from one spot.

I shot in most of the local competitions, but the sixteen pounds of “Old Betsy” did not qualify because they had a limit of 12 pounds for anything up to .25 calibre.I would have to cut some portion off of the barrel and drill holes in the stock and the forearm in order to reduce the weight to get under their weight restrictions and qualify to win the shoot, so I have never modified it.I shoot and am always the highest score and tightest grouping, but I do not take any prize money home.

I managed to trade up the “J.Unertl” free-floating spring-loaded scope that has critical focus range finder rings with “windage” adjustment mounts.All you have to do is turn the rings until your target is in critical focus, read the yardage on the ring on the front of the scope and, adjust for the windage on the mounting rings by estimating the wind put the focused yardage on the elevating rings on the scope, settle down on putting the crosshairs on your target and let off the four-ounce pull on the trigger.I have consistently shot crows at 250 yards and all you get is a puff of black feathers and the wings circling down to the ground independently.Groundhogs have a tendency to go completely into a red cloud when they are hit.I did all of the woodwork on it, and the cheek plate is to fit my face where I hold a rifle, and a big lump of the French Walnut on the fore stock is rounded to fit your hand where the rifle balances that makes for easier carrying the sixteen pounds of a rifle.

I had taken it with me when I went to training in Regina and figured the gophers in the west would represent a bigger challenge, being a lot smaller target.Our troops were housed in barracks in “B” block and on the fourth story.The most use the rifle got was watching the Nurses sun tanning on the roof of the Grey Nuns Hospital half a mile away.Most of the troops were taking turns, lining up to check on the focus on the scope.With .25 cents a minute behind the scope, it is the most money that I have evermade to offset the cost of putting that rifle together.Of course, a few gophers in the west have goneto gopher heaven as well as the crows are not feeling that safe in the area of that rifle.One time, I took it to the range to sight in a .300 magnum Weatherby rifle that one of the members had beenwilled to him by his father.I took 25 shells that I had just reloaded with me.We sighted in the big mule of a rifle 200 yards, and he asked if he could fire the “varmitter”.I told him to see if he could try and hit that little white rock on the embankment out at 500 yards.His first shot hit it with a big cloud of white smoke.He begged to try it again and that begging kept up until I went home with a box of empty cartridges.He wanted to trade me straight across for the $3,000.00 Weatherby, but I did not need to have a mule for recoil in my collection, and I did not think that I had any need to go elephant hunting.
