I recall at the end of the lowering of the flag ceremony myself and another member were marching over to the Sgt. Major’s office to turn in the flag for it to be put up in the morning.As we marched along the parade square, there was a good-looking young lady on the sidewalk, and my partner looked over at me and was smiling. I smiled as well, and when we were about to go up the steps to the Headquarters Building, I noticed the Sgt. Major, looking out of the window of his office.I rapped on the door and waswelcomed in.He said that he saw us ogling that young lady, and I hada problem that an ex-member had died, and the burial ceremony was on Monday.I am going to give you extra duties for ogling that young lady and here are the dimensions and where you are to dig the grave.You will find the picks and shovels in that little building east of the gate to the graveyard.That was Friday night, and we got extra duties for smiling at a good-looking girl.

We went over to the graveyard and located and measured it out and marked in the grave site with our picks and shovels and went back to barracks to take off and clean our red serge and put our Stetson in the hat press polish our sand brown and boots and polish our brass buttons, then went to bed.We got up and went to the stables at 6:00 a.m. and cleaned the barn, fed and groomed the horses, swept all of the floors, and then went back to barracks and changed into our long blues and marched to the mess to have our breakfast and then marched back to the barracks to change into our fatigues, then off to graveyard and began digging.We stopped and went for dinner by ourselves as the rest of the troop had the day off, and we were over half done with the eight-foot hole.

When we came back, there was a class of membersfrom the Regina City Police whowere getting instruction on the use and firing of the tear gas guns.They were over the fence from the graveyard and firing in the other direction.My troop mate kept mentioning that he was pretty nervous about being in a graveyard, especially when he saw all of the sunken areas where he said the casket had fallen in and the ground had sunk down.He blamed me for smiling when I looked at that girl, and I said that I smiled when I looked over at him, and he was showing a lot of ivory.I had taken my turn at picking the hard soil and had cleaned most of the loose dirt out of the hole.And climbed outfor a breather and said it was his turn.He got down and did some picking, and I passed him a shovelat the side of the hole. 

Iwas watching them stand up an old door frame, and the first fellowwas handed the tear gas gun, and I watched him shoot at the door.I could see it hit the top of the frame, andit then went high in the air, and I lost sight of it because of the leaves on the trees above us.

They were practicing with what is called “Flight-rite” shells.They are about an inch and a half in diameter and about 15 inches long, and as they pass out of the barrel of the tear gas gun, there are four sets of fins that are spring loaded, come out and keep the projectile travelling in a straight direction.They are for shooting through windows when the culprit is inside a building from a fair distance back.They are fairly accurate for about 150 yards.The other shorter shells are for firing into a crowd of people, and it just spread the tear gas out about fifty feet, and it would be a fifty-foot wide dispersal of tear gas.We had already taken our tear gas training, and I was interested, looking to see how much the memberwas kicked back from the recoil of the gun.There wasa lot of powder in the cartridge to send that loaded shell for quite a distance.When it wasfired, it lit up the fuse at the back, emitting tear gas and makingthe projectile really hot so it could not be picked up and thrown back at the Police.When it hit the top of the door,It obviously damaged the fins on the back ofone side of the projectile, and itwent away up into the sky, dispersing the gas, and it obviously turned over and came back down in our direction.

The next thingI knew, it came down through the trees and landed in one of the sunken grave sites about ten feet away from my partner with a big “Thunk sound.”He said, “WHAT TO HELL WAS THAT?Hestood up and looked around.There was the tear gas wafting up very gently with white smoke and making this hizzing sound. He immediately jumped up out of the hole, and as he ran past me, he said, “I told you I did not like going into graveyards!”I called to him to come back and he just speeded up his pace and headed for the barracks.I ran after him, and he was lying on his bunk with his pillow over his head.It took a lot of persuading to get him to go back with me.

He said he was about five years old and went with his mum and dad to his uncle’s funeral.And they were lifting up the casket with ropes andcarrying it over to above the grave, then were going to let it down into the grave.He had goneto help them and fell into the hole, and the casket slipped and fell into the hole at an angle, and he was trapped in the hole with the casket angled over himuntil they got ropes around the end of the casket and pulled it back and then got him out of the hole by someone jumping down and lifting him out.It really gave his uncle a memorable send-off.

I kept assuring him that it was just a tear gas shell that landed in that grave.I finally persuaded him to come back with me.By the time we got back to the graveyard, the shell had finished dispersing the tear gas, and the cartridge was still stuck in the middle of the sunken grave.We hollered over to the instructor and I threw the empty shell as far as I could over the fence.We were fortunate that there was a gentlebreeze blowing away from our work site, and the smell of the tear gas did not affect us in finishing the grave-digging exercise.In the eleven months that we were in training, there had to be half a dozen graves dug and filled in with extra duties that werehanded out.We happened to be the third group and only two that had been sentenced to extra duties. The others involved five or six members of our troop digging or filling in the holes.
