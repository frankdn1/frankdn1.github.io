I had the pleasure ofBig Mikein the North, and then when I came out of the North, he was the N.C.O. i/c Grande Prairie Detachment, and a story comes to mind that on Halloween, he was a typical hands-on kind of guy, and was out on patrol with the rest of us.When I was in Carcrossin the Yukon, I accompanied him and two other members to go to Anchorage to shoot a friendly competition against the Alaska State Police.We were going up the Alaska Highway, and this American vehicle would pass us and then stop to take pictures of goats, sheep, or moose on the roadside and then pass us again, and we had to eat their dust.This repeated for the next hundred miles. 

When we stopped at the border to stretch our legs and take a picture of the Welcome to Alaska sign, they were getting the firearms out of the trunk, and one guy was shouting, “It was good to be back in the land of the free,” and was strapping on his .44 Magnum revolver.He started to do repeated quick draws.On one of the pulls out of the holster, the revolver went off and cut a strip down the side of his leg.We managed to get the first aid box out of the trunk, and Big Mike patched him up and they were off to the hospital in Tok.When we got to Anchorage, I went into the bank to get some American money, and a chap walked in with two big pearl-handled pistols strapped on his waist.I looked at him as he stood in line behind me, and I saw Mike outside opening the trunk and, getting our revolvers and ammunition out and passing them onto the other members.They thought that it was going to be a bank robbery, and they were getting prepared to stop the culprit.I had been to the shoot in Fairbank the years before and knew that it was legal the pack a revolver if it was openly displayed. 

I was in charge of the Highway Patrol Unit and I arranged our shifts so that all six of us were working nights and patrolling the communities surrounding Grande Prairie to keep track of the revelers.I came back into Grande Prairie and Parked my car in the garage.I was walking on the main street, and I saw a group throwing eggs at the windows across the street. I ran after the guy in the light-colored jacket, and the other four ran into the parking lot with a lot of vehicles, and he headed right up the sidewalk ahead of me when I hollered, “Stop, Police,” he just sped up and in half a block I managed to over take him and grabbed his left arm, and we came to a stop.I asked him why he was throwing eggs and he said he did not throw any eggs.I asked him what are the names of the other guys that were throwing eggs,what are the names of your buddies then?

About that time, Mike came up to the both of us from across the street.He had been hit with one of the eggs on the left shoulder.Mike said that he had been hit with one of the eggs that you threw and was looking right down on this guy's face.This chap had a very light brown doe-skin jacket with four pockets on the front, and I had him by the one arm.Mike asked if he was throwing eggs, and he replied that he did not have any eggs.At that point, Mike patted him quite forcefully on the chest pockets and the lower pockets and said if you don’t have any eggs, then you had better bugger off.I let go of him, and he ran off into the darkness.Mike said, “That’s the bugger that threw the egg that hit me, and I am glad you were able to run faster than he could because I could not have caught him.”

I was in the office early the next morning, and this same chap came in and had his doe-skin jacket over his arm.I went to the front desk and introduced myself, and he said he wanted the Police to pay for his $400.00 jacket as it had been ruined by a big son of a bitch of a policeman.He was displaying the jacket with huge soiled areas below all four pockets and up the front about four inches above each pocket.I asked him, “Do you know which policeman it was that ruined the jacket,” “Last night, you told me that you did not have any eggs?”“That you and did not throw any eggs,”“That is why we let you go.”He said he did not know his name, but he was a really big son of a bitch.I said I was the one last night that you told me that you did not have any eggs and you did not throw and eggs, right?How did he ruin your jacket if you did not have any eggs and you did not throw any eggs? That was what you told the both of us last night.”

I asked him his name and wrote it down and told him that I was going to introduce him to the N.C.O. in charge, and he wouldtake a statement from you.I walked him into Mike’s office,introduced him, and said this is the chap that last night told us that he did not have any eggs and denied throwing eggs.Luckily Mike stayed seated and bothered to take his statement.I interjected that he had just told me that it was a big son of a bitch of a policeman that ruined his $400.00 jacket, and he did not know his name.Mike dutifully took a statement and said he would look into the matter further, and the chap left with his $400.00 jacket.

 Mike had a meeting with the father of this chap, and I heard nothing further of the matter as I understand that Mike took his brown serge jacket with him to the meeting that was all egg stained on the shoulder and all down the front, and I understand that dry cleaning took care of the egg mess on his jacket.I don’t believe that the doe-skin jacket could so easily have been cleaned or restored.
