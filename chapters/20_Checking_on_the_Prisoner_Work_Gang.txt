The Yukon government had begun to improve the Chilkoot Trail that runs from the south end of Bennett Lake alongside Lake Livermore, although all of it is in the Province of British Columbia. They were doing it with the help of time-serving prisoners, and they had just one guard who kept them in line and working. My job was to check on them at least once every 6 to 10 days and transport prisoners who wanted to work outside while serving their time. I was also to provide transportation back to Whitehorse, bringing back chaps who had served their time.

It meant going the full length of Bennett Lake, some 25 miles by freighter canoe, and then walking the prepared trail to where they had their tent camp set up, another eight to ten miles, and hauling in some of their fresh fruit. Once a month, I hauled their fresh grocery order from Carcross and was met with the entire group at Bennett. They leveled out areas on the trail and built small bridges across the creeks, continuing that all the way to the top of the Chilkoot Pass by the Canada/U.S. border.
