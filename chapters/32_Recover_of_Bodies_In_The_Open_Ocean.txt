When we got the Services Diving Club up and running, and after a few members were trained, we usually had divers available for underwater recovery missions. Initially, the Canadian Army, Navy, Air Force, and RCMP were involved. Later, members from Memorial University, particularly those involved in Marine Biology studies, joined us. I had been selected to go to New York to get my instructor’s rating. Most of the interested members had done their training in one or more local pools, completed their open-water tests, and had a few dives under their belts.

I was contacted and informed that a group of locals had held a big party on the beach down by Logy Bay. During the night, they decided to push a rotten old dory back off the beach and head towards a cod trap to catch some fish. Five of them were in the dory, using driftwood as paddles. Shortly after setting off, yelling and screaming were heard, followed by silence. The next morning, the dory was found back on the beach, with the back of it broken out. It was believed that one of them had fallen backward and broken the dory, causing it to sink with everyone aboard.

With the cold waters of the North Atlantic, very few Newfoundlanders learn to swim, as most rivers are rapid-filled, and even the smaller lakes rarely warm up enough for comfortable swimming. I got three other divers interested in joining me inthe search. We located the campfire, which was still smoldering, and the locals pointed out the location of the cod trap about a mile off the point. Several boats were already searching the bay for survivors, and we commandeered one of the trap skiffs to take us offshore. We also requested that the other boats tie onto the skiff to ensure we weren’t run over while diving.

It was decided that we would conduct a search pattern between the campfire and the cod trap. We would swim for five minutes, then gather at the boat based on our bubble trails. At each interval, the boats would drop their anchors, and we would conduct search patterns from that point, using visibility between divers as the width of our pattern. After each five-minute swim, we would gather, check the compass direction using a chalkboard I had, and spread out to the visibility limit before starting the next leg of the search.

On the third search, I was the first to find one of the victims. On their way back, the others found two more bodies at a depth of 50 feet. We surfaced, but it was difficult to get the fishermen to assist in getting the bodies into the boats, partly due to fear of dead bodies and concern about what other villagers might say. Eventually, they helped us.

We continued the search and soon found the fourth body. This time, the fishermen were more willing to assist. While diving, I kept track of my surroundings, checking the compass heading and maintaining an equal distance from my partners. At one point, I noticed a shadow and thought my dive partner was getting ahead of me. I kicked harder to keep up. When the five-minute leg ended, I stopped to gather with the others. One of my partners grabbed the chalkboard and wrote, “Why so fast?” with a couple of question marks. The others read it and pointed at me.

It turned out that the shadow I had been following was not my dive partner but a great white shark, at least 15 feet long and three feet in diameter, which had passed between the four of us just two feet away. We all immediately surfaced and got into the boat with the lowest sides. It was agreed that our search for the fifth person was over, as we believed the shark had likely eaten the last victim.

Fishermen in Newfoundland often discard the heads and innards of their catch back into the ocean, attracting various species of sharks. There have been sightings of 28 different species of sharks in Canadian waters, 14 of which are commonly found around Newfoundland. Hammerhead sharks are often seen while diving, and I had encountered whale sharks, longfin makos, sandbar sharks, silky sharks, and Icelandic cat sharks, but this was my first encounter with a great white shark. Having witnessed several of them attacking seals on a beach near Harbour Breton, it was not an experience I wanted to repeat.

This was the first open-ocean body recovery by scuba divers that I know of. Two of the divers were members of the RCMP;one was with Army Intelligence, and another was a Major in the Army. I had the sad duty of notifying the next of kin for the four families, recounting our close call with the great white shark that ended the search for their seventeen-year-old son.
