An early morning call from the Bank of Commerce reported that the front door of the bank was open, and there was blood on the entrance and stairs leading to the second floor.I responded and the entrance to the attic was open, and the blood trail continued to the rear of the bank and to where a boat had been driven into the shore.There was a rugged wooden ladder made from Lodge Pole Pine that was still leaning against the back of the bank building leading to the roof.I climbed the ladder, and a hole had been chopped through the roof that led to the attic, and it was piled with cancelled cheques and bank records several feet thick in areas.I found a small packsack with six sticks of dynamite and the timed fuse but no blasting caps.I located a bundle of cancelled cheques fromRobert Service near the open access to the second floor with a drop of possibly ten feet, where there was a railing running across the open stairway.It was obvious that the culprits had dropped from the opening, encountered the railing, and been seriously injured.

It was decided that it was more than likely some persons from Alaska had been involved and possibly may be still heading down river and I should fly the river to see if they had not made it back to Alaska.I flew the river north and encountered only one boat that was about ten miles short of the border going northwest at that time.I made a low pass, and as I went over the boat, a person under the canvas poked his head out.So, I assumed they were the persons responsible, and I could see that they both had heavy beards.I did not have time to file a flight plan to enter Alaska, and I tried contacting the airport at Circle, as that was the only airport that was alongside the Yukon River, and I could not get a response on the radio.I radioed Fairbanks, and they tried phoning their Customs agent in Circle, but they got no response.

When I got to Circle and located that airport, there was a herd of horses scattered all over the airport.I made a number of low passes and finally scared them off the runway and landed.I was greeted by a member of the Alaska State Police and a very agitated person claiming he was the Customs Agent, though he had no uniform on.I explained what had happened and that the two persons responsible were in a boat and more than likely be arriving on the river within the hour.The Customs Agent kept rattling on about seizing the aircraft, and the Alaska State Policeman, with a big wink, said he was placing me under arrest and would be taking me into custody.We went for a coffee at the local grocery store, and he phoned the chap with the ambulance when I described the path of blood to the boat, so he would need some serious medical attention and escorted to Fairbanks when they got to Circle.He said that the two,whowere more than likely brothers that had a pretty poor gold claim, were working up one of the Creeks in the area, and they were a couple of the town rowdies, and he had dealt with them several times in the time they were in the Circle area.

We went down to the boat launch area and watched as the boat arrived and we helped the ambulance driver put him in the ambulance.He had broken his upper leg, and the bleeding was controlled by a tourniquet that he had on his upper leg.He was advised that he would remain in custody at the Hospital in Fairbanks until they figured out how they would handle the attempted bank robbery in Canada.He arrested the other brother, and we returned to his office.I obtained a statement from the subject, and his brother was the first one to drop out of the ceiling and hit the railing.He lowered himself down and dragged him down the stairs and out to the boat, and they left.They had gone to Dawson City for the big celebration on the 17th of August and cased out both banks and figured that the Bank of Commerce was the easiest target as it was right at the river’s edge.They came back home and built the ladder,got some dynamite to blow the safe, and said that the dynamite caps were still in the boat.The Customs Agent came to the office all gussied up in his uniform, and he had contacted his superiors in Fairbanks, and he would not be seizing the aircraft if I promised to fly back directly to Dawson City owing to the seriousness of the attempted bank robbery.

With the difficulty of getting the brothers extradited back into Canada, no formal charges were pursued.I shared the cancelled cheques with the manager of the bank, and I continued togive away the “Robert Service cheques” until I was down to just two left that were dated 1910 to neighbours, friends, and acquaintances and I decided to frame them as well as “Traveller’s cheque” in the amount of $100.00 dated 1925,as mementos of the Yukon and my first and only attempted bank robbery investigation.
