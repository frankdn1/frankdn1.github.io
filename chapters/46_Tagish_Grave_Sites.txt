When I was in charge of Carcross Detachment in 1965, I got a number of calls to attend the area of the Tagish River Bridge to examine human bones that were found on the river’s edge on the east side of the river.As the water went down different people located the bones at the water’s edge.On the west side of the 18 hundred foot bridge, there is a Native settlement of a number of homes, and on the east side, there is a Territorial parking lotto accommodate the endless number of fishermen that use the bridge to catch five different varieties of fish that come up the river to feed from the Nares Lake about five miles north of the bridge.A few hundred feet back from the parking lot is the ceremonial platform and then the Native grave sites that run randomly out to the edge of the river bank through some pine and spruce trees.The soil in the area is mostly perma-frost and thawing with the effects of the perpetual summer sun and the presence of river water.

The river bank is about 30 feet high from the edge to flow of the water in the river to the top of the bank and it is gradually being eaten away with the high volume of water during the spring run-off.There area number of grave houses with the assorted personal effects of the deceased, and they are scattered amongthe trees all the way out to the river bank.

From the road along the west side of the river, with a set of binoculars, I could see the remnants of at least six graves that have been partially or entirely eroded away.

I had built a grave box and carried a pick and shovel in the trunk of thePolice Car and would gather up the human remains that had been found and put them in the trunk of the vehicle and go over and dig a hole and burry them in a vacant area of the Native graveyard and I had made crosses with a pointed bottom out of ¾ inch plywood that I had paintedwhite, and I would put the date of the reinternment and initial it.This occurred three times in a month and I carried a spare grave box in the trunk for that purpose.I made repeated trips to the Native graveyardevery time I had occasion to drive in that area to try and prevent people from pilfering the items that were in the grave houses.I was also patrolling there to check the fishermen for their Yukon Fishing license.I had a great number of Americans whoworked on building the Alaska Highway and were coming from Alaska or going to Alaska that knew of the good fishing spot of the Tagish River Bridge.I could introduce them to a Yukon Fishing Licence.

The grave site at Tagish is about a 20 - 30 mile lake trip from Carcross to the Tagish River, and locating the grave site was a two-day trek up and down the east shore of the Tagish River.Members in the past had never been able to locate the gravesite.I believe they drowned in 1899 or 1900 from memory.I was able to locate the old Tagish Post, and the horse stable was dug into the ground (I guess to keep the horses warm in the winter and save on building materials) because only the doorway and some timbers were still left at the scene and there wasa perimeter of stones where the main building was located.The grave site was located almost two miles south ofthe Post on a slight hill.The river bank is about 40 feet high from the water's edge and the graves were located in a nice poplar glade with simple deteriorated wooden crosses.I spent another day cutting the trees around the site and removingall the weeds in the area and plantingsome local flowers on the grave site, erected the headboards that I had routered their names and date of death, took a few pictures, and left.

I no more than got back to the Detachment in Carcross and picked up my mail.The first letter I opened was the direction to dig up the members and have them buried in the graveyard at Dawson City.I conned one of the Auxiliary Members and a new recruit that were stationed in Whitehorse for a good fishing trip; if they would help me on the digging trip.We caught several big lake trout and camped there in the perpetual daylight and we camp fried and ate a lot of fish.We spent hours digging.I was in one grave, and the other two dug in the second grave.We continued to dig because you could see the disturbed soil lines on the sides of the graves.I dug in one grave, and they took turns shovelling in the other. I managed to get down to the first casket ahead of them as I shovelled a narrow hole when I did not locate the casket above the six-foot mark. We removed the remains and put them into smaller caskets that I had built, and they took them back to Whitehorse to begin the transfer to Dawson City, where they were again interned.

The Tagish bridge is 1800 feet long, and the Yukon Government had seen fit to build a campsite on the east end of the bridge as it was a favourite site for fishing off of the bridge as there were about half a dozen varieties of fish that were available to the anglers.Unfortunately, there was a Carcross Tagish Native grave site a few hundred feet back from the border of the campsite and all along the river bank.Every year, more of the graves were disturbed by the river banks being washed away, and human bones would be turned in at the Detachment.I would return them to the site and bury them further back from the river bank.There was a lot of vandalism to the grave houses, and their ceremonial platform had not been maintained over the years. 

 The local natives had fallen several tall spruce trees over it to afford it some protection.I was making regular patrols to try and protect the area, and as the water receded, I would search the river bank for new bones andbury the bones that I located downstream from the grave site before they were discovered and turned into the Detachment in Carcross.

About this time, Allen Innis Taylor, a retired ex-Northwest Mounted Policeman, arrived at my Detachment.He was hired on by Indian Affairs to locate the sites of all of the known Native Gravesites in the Yukon and had old correspondence describing the different locations.I told him to get in the Police car, and I would drive him over to Tagish, and we could be back in an hour, as I knew where it was located and visited it numerous times.He indicated that the only way of locating it correctly was to travel by water, and he had permission from the Commanding Officer in Whitehorse to use RCMPequipment and manpower to assist him in locating the graves.I knewAllen InnisTaylor and his wife from my posting at Dawson City. 

I had escorted his wife to the Mental Health Unit in Whitehorse during the previous winter and had attended their residence several times when she had gone violent on him with her dementia attacks.During his service, he had been seconded to look after the dogs when Scott made his trip to the South Pole, and unfortunately, he had been beaten by Roal Amundsen by five weeks, and Scott and four of his crew perished on the return trip.I had listened to many of his tales over coffee as he often visited the Detachment at all hours of the day and night.

I told him I was not going by boat because there was a wind cloud on Nares Mountain, and we had to cross Windy Arm to get to the Tagish Lake and Tagish River before it ran into Marsh Lake.He showed me his authorization papers, and I still refused to take him there by water when we could drive there in half an hour.He left in a huff, and I watched him as he got in his car and drove directly to the hotel.About 20 minutes later, I got a call fromthe Commanding Officer. And I was to take Allen Taylor by boat and assist him in any way possible.I told him we could drive there in twenty minutes to half an hour andI was very familiar with the gravesite and patrolled there regularly.As I told Mr. Taylor, I had been to the Indian grave site many times and investigated the damage caused by the tourists using the adjacent park that was about a hundred feet apart.I told him that I could see the wind clouds on the top of the mountain in that area and figured it was not safe to go by boat, and he replied to honour his wishes as he had old papers that describedthe location from the waterof the Tagish River from a particular bluff of trees.I told him that the bluff of trees was where the Native village of Tagish was located on the west side of the Tagish River.The native graveyard was across the Tagish Bridge on the other side of the river, and I had been there quite a number of times dealing with the human bones that had been washed into the river from a grave that had been buried too close to the eroding bank and damage caused by the tourists at the park that was possibly only a hundred feet away from the graveyard. 

Needless to say I was not that pleased with the directions of the Officer Commanding of the Yukon Subdivison.I locked up the office and left a note on the door of my detachment building saying that I was going to Tagish by water and to phone Whitehorse if they needed a policeman before I returned.I left the number for the Whitehorse Detachment on the note.

I picked him up at the Hotel coffee shop and took my two fuel tanks, fishing gear, and rifle down to the boat.We had a 26-foot freighter canoe with only one 18 HP outboard motor on it at the time.It had a six-foot beam, and I knew it would take some really big waves as I had been caught out on Bennett Lake with ten-foot waves.There was nothing in the boat other than a big 30-foot square canvas tarpaulin that I used to cover the boat with when it was not in use. I took no food or camping equipment other than my fishing rod and rifle because I anticipated being back in 8 or 9 hours and would wet a line while he inspected the grave site.I knew the bluff of trees that wereon the west shore, and it was where the Native settlement of Tagish was located and was at the end of 1800 foot Tagish River Bridge.

 Windy Arm is a body of water that is possibly15 miles long and three to four miles wide with several barren rocky islands about three-quarters the way across the mouth of the arm but slightly up into the Arm.The Tagish people called it “Todezzane,”meaning wind blowing all the time. The wind was from the south, and we were intent on going directly east.The big rollers were getting rather difficult to handle before we got closer to Windy Arm.As we got closer to Windy Arm, the winds increased considerably and I had to head into the wind and waves to prevent from being swamped.I figured I could make it to the islands and then turn down the wind at an angle to clear the Arm, but the wind increased to possibly 90 + mph, blowing a froth of water into the boat from the top of the cresting waves, and I had to continuously bale the accumulated water at the back of the boat.I managed to make it to the lee of the islands and decided we would have to beach the canoe as we could not have enough gas to keep it going almost full speed and all the time angling slightly across the open water of the Windy Arm.Until the wind subsided, I would not be able to turn sideways in such a strong wind to be able to turn around and head back to the safety of Carcross.

I had the tarpaulin tied at the front and then underneath the front twart and then above the next two twarts and tied along the starboard side and back over most of myself by the rear seat to prevent some of the water from entirely soaking me.Mr. Taylor lay down across the front seat under thetarp and out of the wind as the canoe has a six-foot beam, and he used the extra life jackets as a pillow.For over two hours we headed into the wind and slowly angled across the Windy Arm and managed to get into the lee of the most northerly rocky Island and made it to the stony beach. 

We hauled the canoe up on shore using the paddles and two ores to protect the canvas and painted the bottom up on a sharp gravel beach.About the time we got it turned over, it began to rain heavily.We used the canvas to lieon and stop some of the wind and rain from coming into our shelter.I tried fishing when the rain stopped.You could cast almost all of my line out downwind and managed to catch one lake trout and a four-pike in short order.There was no wood on the island, not even small branches or even chips of wood, just an 80-foot spire of rock that was several hundred feet long and the sharp rock and gravel beach on the north end, so making a firefor warmth was out of the question.

I later learned that the Outfitter,whohad his residence on the North shore, had been watching our attempt to cross Windy Arm with the aid of his binoculars and then saw us land on the island and phoned the Whitehorse Detachment to advise them that we were safe on the island as he recognised the RCMP boat with the crest and the RCMP lettering that I had made for the short planked in the area on the bow of the 26-foot freighter canoe.

We ate raw fish for the next three days, and I had to listen to Allen Taylor recall all of his stories at the top of his voicebecause of the howling wind and rattling of the canvas.We were most uncomfortable as the lake water never really warms up, even in the middle of summer, even with the 24-hour daylight.When our clothes dried up, it was a little better, but the air over the lake was still uncomfortably cold, and the wind was coming down off the glaciers on the mountains to the south.There were no soft spots under the layers of canvas on the rocky beach with absolutely no sand, and the only comfort was the padded, lumpy life vests that we used for pillows.

On the fourth day, the wind subsided just before noon, and we turned the boat over, dragged it back into the water, installed the motor, and headed out for the Tagish Bridge. In less than an hour, we were tied up there.He inspected the Native gravesite, took a number of pictures, and made a few notes, and we boated back to Carcross. I went directly to Whitehorse and met with the Officer Commanding to thank him for my having to put up with Allan Innis Taylor’s company, and hemade light of the subject by saying that he would not deduct my wages for the four-day camping holiday that I must have enjoyed.

 

1987Edmonton Tornado – F4 Tornado – Black Friday

I was one of the RCMP members that attended the Emergency Response Meetings and helped make plans of how to respond to different maladies in weather, flooding, heavy snowfalls, fires, earthquakes, and how to deal with possible fires at the four refineries and pipeline leaks and power outages.In mid-July, the topic of a Tornado was on the agenda.It was taken fairly lightly by the people involved at the beginning of the meeting as no one had ever experienced a tornado.As a teenager, I had experienced “Hurricane Hazel” back in Ontario and was very familiar with the devastation that occurred from just heavy rain and strong winds.I remained troubled by the lack of preparedness of our community officials, with the endless devastation that resulted from the tremendous amount of water that came down and power outages.

I cautioned those attending that we should take a serious look at planning to have a total plan of preparedness put together.We started with pages of phone numbers of all emergency centres, television, radio, hospitals in the area, ambulances, fire halls, towing companies,heavy lift and equipment services, aircraft and helicopter contacts, as well as names of personnel that wasin charge as contact people.Having four refineries in the immediate area of Sherwood Park and Edmonton, with fires in the refractors and huge storage tanks of propane, gasoline, and diesel on-site in the area.A system of code had to be set up to ensure the security of the call was established so that the fires could be extinguished because of the huge costs of shutting down and starting up a refinery.Once we began to accept the immensity of establishing contact phone numbers and personnel, the meeting extended into evening hours.

 Arrangements were made to have a copy of the Emergency file distributed to the Edmonton Police Department and all of the Detachments in the Edmonton area.I remember that the booklet of Tornado Preparedness arrived on my desk on Wednesday.Just before 1:30 p.m. on Friday, I was listening to the local radio, and I was advised that the warning of a thunderstorm with the possibility of large hail was broadcast.And Ilooked over at the Tornado Preparedness booklet in the filing basket.I was in the middle of planning to look after the parking and traffic control for the Commonwealth Games that was to start on Saturday. 

Just before 2:00 p.m., one of the members on patrol reported on the radio that there looked like a tornado coming out of a very dark cloud just south of Edmonton. He said he thought it was heading our way, and it looked serious and directed us to go outside and to look out of the Detachment and see what was happening.I got in the police car with my camera,took a quick trip,and took a few pictures.After that, Ireturned to the office and began to make phone calls.I got in touch with the different refineries and gave them the code and the warning of the impending tornado that was headed north just on the outskirts of Edmonton.One of the refineries questioned me if I knew how much it would cost to shut down and start up a refinery, and I told him that he was about to find out just how expensive it was because he was to begin shutting it down right now.I phoned the radio stations, TV stations,hospitals,Fire halls, and ambulances and turned the list over to our radio dispatcher and asked that she continue making the calls from where I left off and have another secretary contact everyone of the members and have them come to the office ASAP.

I got in the police car and made my way down the Sherwood Park Freeway to try and stop the traffic from driving into the tornado as it looked like it was about to cross the freeway.I parked the police car obliquely across two lanes of the highway, angled slightly, got out in the driving rain, and attempted to flag people off the freeway and onto 17th Street as the black twister was about to pass over the Freeway.There was a large number of the big garbage bins that had been lifted up into the cloud and were banging around against one another with deafening bangs.I just avoided being run over by an Orange van and followed right after that with an Oldsmobile station wagon with a woman driver whowas obviously looking at the storm ahead and not my exaggerated arm movements and with me in a florescent orange raincoat.

I managed to get a line of cars stopped and told the drivers not to go any further along the freeway.I moved up onto 17th Street to try and prevent the traffic from paralleling the tornado as the path was uncertain at that time, and it began hailing as soon as I got a couple vehicles stopped.I got a lot of static from one of the drivers as he wanted to go into his office in the industrial area and retrieve his petty cash and float.I told him that if he moved forward, I would shoot the tires out on his vehicle, and he continued to cuss me and question my mother’s marriage.The hail stones were getting bigger, and I got hit with one on the shoulder that was the size of a tennis ball and ran for the car.I just got into the car, and the rattle of hail on the roof was continuous.The next thing I knew, there was a really big bang on the front of the vehicle, and I figured that the upset driver had thrown a big rock at the Police car, and I got out to assess the damage and deal with him.

As I went to the front of the police car, the entire grill area was smashed out, and on the ground was a huge chunk of clear ice about six inches across that had struck the car.I decided to move south on 17th Street to get out of the hail, and just as I was underway, the entire roof of one of the warehouses went up into the air and went behind me and the next time I saw it, the entire roof was like a leaf and swooping down right in front of me, and I looked in the rearview mirror as it crashed into the industrial area.I turned around and went back north on 17th Street, and the tornado was lifting holiday trailers out of the yard on the south side of the Freeway;they would spin around faster and faster until the body part flew apart and the metal frame, axles, and tires would come crashing back to earth.One after another, theywent up a couple hundred feet and got the same treatment.The trucking firm on the south of the entire building, beginning with the office, then the two hundred feet of warehouse, went up into the cloud, and a loaded truck and trailer went up about 100 feet and circled in the air and went back down over by the fence of the trucking firm yard.There were endless pieces of lumber flying around, and I found out that three people were killed in that lumber company yard on the south side of the Freeway.Quite a number of industrial buildings got an exaggerated lean and then disintegrated and went up into the black cloud as it moved forward just a few miles an hour.The base of the swirling mass where the destruction was taking place was about a mile wide.As it moved north, I went into the industrial area to see if I could locate anyone that needed help.

I located the orange van that almost hit me about half a mile from the Freeway.It was in five or six pieces, and so was the driver.I found the Oldsmobile station wagon about half a mile away, and all four tires were flat, so it must have come down from a considerable way up.The woman driver was still in the vehicle with her hands straight out, still holding onto the steering wheel.I tapped on the window, and she let the window down.I asked her if she was all right, and her response to me was, “Would you look in the back and see if my golf clubs are O.K.?”She was in total shock.I assisted her into the police car and took her to one of the ambulances, and her only injury was a broken collar bone from contact with the seat belt.She had to have been up in the cloud for ten minutes because the tornado was only going forward at about ten miles an hour.I drove into the industrial area and discovered one of the warehouses that had trucks that used radioactive canisters for cameras to examine the welds on the pipeline.The entire building was gone, leaving only the cement pad, and obviously, the radioactive canisters had gone up into the cloud, so another major concern was broadcast, and it was decided that the entire area would have to be closed until those canisters were located.For the next two weeks, the entire area was closed to the public until we had the Canadian Army with Geiger counters and members searching abreast until searching the entire area and until they all were located.I had my camera with me the entire time, and it resulted in me recording 178 scenes of destruction that havebecome one of my many albums.

One of the funny situations comes to mind. I was approached by one of the known hippies, and he stopped me on the road andquestionedme on who was going to pay for the six-inch square of a window pane that was the only damage that his house had received during the tornado.There was a Karagana hedge next door to the house, and then there was a blank cement pad several hundred feet square of cement where there had been heavy machinery and offices of a complete machine shop, and this piece of intelligence was concerned about his window pane and who was going to pay to have it replaced.

Before the tornado, there was a guy whowas trying to bum gasoline and had gone into the trucking firm with his empty five-gallon container and they put him off by telling him that they only had diesel fuel for their trucks.He had gone back to his car and had his plastic container in front of him as he sat watching the tornado.The company staff wasin the office looking at the destruction of one of the buildings at the steel plant across the field, and all of a sudden, a four by eight feet sheet of quarter-inch steel came through the windows at the other end of the office, and they headed out to go into the pits in the garage.This gas bum was sitting in his car right in front of the office watching the tornado, and the long rafters from a roof truss company across the road went up in the air, and one of them came around and went through the back window of his car and through the seat and into him pinning him and the gas can against the steering wheel.A female member heard him screaming and called me to assist in getting him out of the car.We summoned an ambulance, and when they arrived, I helped the attendant pull the 2 X 4 out of the back window and they loaded him in the ambulance, and the female member, for some unknown reason, went with him in the ambulance to the hospital and left the police car without the keys in the parking lot.He died in the hospital.

Another member in the area discovered a man whohad been holding onto a Coke dispensing unit when it was crumpled by the cement tankers,landedon top of it and was trapped and yelling his head off.The member wanted me to dispatch a wrecker to see if we could rescue him.I went there after the wrecker arrived; the member was distressed bythe size of the wrecker that I had sent.I discovered that there were four loaded cement tankers piled one on top of another and the man was held by the buckle of his belt trapped in a crumple of the metal coke container.I crawled in and cut the back of his belt with myjackknife, and he crawled out as I did.It took several big cranes to lift and put those cement tankers back on their wheels.

The path of the tornado turned just before it went into the refinery area and sort of followed the North Saskatchewan River.It had just missed two forty-foot round propane storage tanks.Talking with refinery executives, they told me that had just one of those tanks had been damaged and caught fire, the possibility of the fire using up the oxygen to burn that amount of fuel; they figured that the survival area from lack of oxygenfor all residents and animals would possibly be about 60 miles radius and over a million people would have perished.

I interviewed the railroad workers and they had been in their line shack and had been eating their late lunch, and they saw the tornado pulling the rails and ties out of the ground just up from their shack as well as large gas lines that had been buried five feet into the ground.They all went into the change area and wrapped their arms around one another, holding the handles of the lockers.Then, the roof was torn off the building, and when they looked up, there was a 150-foot fuel storage tank circling right over their heads.And was slowly turning and then crashed about 100 feet away from their shack.All five of them were unscathed. 

To provide exact details on the Edmonton tornado, it was on the ground from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and its winds made it a category 4 on the Fujita Scale.It travelled in an erratic swath of destruction for 30.8 km or 19.1 miles with a width of 1.3 km wide and was estimated to have caused 647 million dollars of property damage.It killed a total of 27 people and injured over 300.It is recorded to have lots of tennis ball-sized hail, and I can attest toone huge chunk of ice that took the grill out of the Police car.It is considered the worst and most destructive tornado in Canada’s history.In the two weeks, we spent looking for those radioactive lead canisters, the entire area was closed to the public; as we searched, it was hampered by thousands of unidentified pieces of anything and everything, and we managed to find all of them with no radioactive leaks.I managed to record 178 pictures of the record of the destructive forces and trail of damage that it left behind that I still have in one of my albums.

Some of the damaged filing cabinets were found in fields as much as 60 miles from where they left the trucking firm, and some of the big metal bins made a 20-mile journey.Two sets of washers and driers were found with the delivery material inside them some 60 miles away from the trailer park near Fort Saskatchewan, where the majority of the people lost their lives.There were all sorts of queer things that you encountered.I was checking the two-story office building and grabbed the handle of the door, and the frame and the door fell in.The entire wall of the outside of that portion of the building was missing, and yet the pile of paperwork was still on the desk neatly stacked and filing cabinets were on the ground outside. 

One of the taxi drivers had a client whowanted to be dropped off at a building when the tornado hit with the idea of getting in a basement.He left, and the driver decided to stay in the vehicle.The bricks on the wall of the three-story building came down on top of the cab, and we had a six-inch high taxi cab driver.A lot of the parked cars that were about 500 feet from the Freeway left the parking lot and were damaged a lot, but were parked one after another out on the right lane of the Freeway, and a lot of them were severely damaged.Places wherefull pallets of cement were taken out of the missing back wall of a warehouse, and right next to where the cement went missing werepallets of light zone-a-light was left still stacked there alongside where tons of cement in bags went missing.The turning tower, where the transmission line went north alongside Edmonton.It had four cement stanchions that were ten feet in the ground and five feet in diameter.They were pulled out of the ground, and the metal of the tower and half a mile of cable werewound tightly around the twisted steel of the tower. 

One of the welding and manufacturing companies had their welding rods that were stored in heated cabinets.I went into the building to check for bodies and the winds inside the building had taken the welding rods out of the cabinet, and the twelve-inch posts that supported the second story down the middle of the room looked like a mad porcupine as the welding rods were sticking in ever side of those post for a good portion of the room.There were many parking lots where vehicles were piled three and four deep if there was a building nearby.

I could go on for many pages as the photographs area good reminder of the carnage as a result of the tornado.They help bring to mind all the areas that we searched the area looking for those radioactive canisters and a reminder of the funny incidents that happened as a result of the devastation that it caused and some of the pictures depict some of the more curious incidents.It is hard to believe the suction that was required to lift those around 40-pound lead containers, and some of them were scattered almost a mile from the industrial building that used to contain them.The forces involved in lifting an empty oil storage tank that was fifty feet tall on the sides and 150 in diameter and carrying it over half a mile and a couple hundred feet in the air, the forces are unbelievable.

There were full filing cabinets that were deposited in fields anywhere from 30 to 45 miles to the north of where they were picked up from offices in the Industrial buildings.The fact it was on the ground for over an hour, and the path was almost a mile wide with the destruction of buildings and property, was so extensive.When it got to the trailer park up by Fort Saskatchewan, so many people were killed in that areabecause there were no basements to hide in, and the trailers were not tied down in any manner.Our search was hampered bythousands of shrouds of metal and building material covering the area of its path, and debris spread for a mile beyond the devastation area that came back down from the cloud.
