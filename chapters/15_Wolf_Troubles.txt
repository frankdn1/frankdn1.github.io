When I was stationed at Dawson City, I befriended a chap whowas the head of the Yukon Forest Service and Game Management, making him an ex-officio game warden.He lived in the settlement with his wife and two boys, and I often was invited to have supper with them.I worked with him studying the caribou migration, travelling the creeks to check on the miners for the Mining Recorder as a predator control in the two years that I spent at Dawson City.I had a good camera and a number of lenses.I did a lot of my own developmentand had a dark room set up in the basement of the detachment, as well as an enlarger.I flew an aircraft, and when the caribou began their migration in the spring and fall, I would go up to 10,000 feet and follow the herd and take pictures of the migrating Caribou.In the spring, we would follow the herd.I would take pictures and then blow thepictures up so we could count the number in the herd.Then in the fall, we would take pictures of them returning with their calves.This way, he could tell the birth rate and the overall health of the herd.

In the spring, we would take similar pictures and compare them to the numbers in the fall.So,we could then get some idea of the prediction of the herd in the Eagle Plain area from the wolves, wolverines, and bears.At the end of the second season of our amateurish herd count, it was obvious that the loss in number over the winter months was caused by extremely cold weather.And the wolf numbers had increaseddramatically, which was another reason whythe caribou count was down considerably.He convinced the Yukon Government to put a bounty on the wolves. To see if that would help.He put out poisonedbates on the roads that we could reach with his four-by-four vehicle when there were a number of woof tracks in the area.

The caribou in the Dawson herd is referred to as the“Forty Mile Herd” because they have been known to go on their migration and travel forty miles in one 24-hour period.They winter in the Eagle Plain, which is a couple of hundred miles northeast of Dawson City, and then in the spring, they go west of Canada and the U.S. border and calve and fatten up on the tundra south of Prudeau Bay near the Arctic Coast.The wolves drop off and welp their pups and continue feeding them on the local deer,moose, buffalo, rabbits, and bird nests, and very few, if any, of the wolves follow that caribou herd.

There is another big herd in the north end of the Eagle Plain and north of Old Crow to the Arctic coast, and they are referred to as“The Porcupine Herd.”The U.S. Fish & Game Department wasdoing a photo censusproject on that herd, and I checked out their numbers in 2018, the herd topped out at 83,000, and in 2022, they were down to 38,000, it is obvious that they will have to limit the indiscriminate hunting of the Indigenous people as a total food source.I have watched them shoot as many caribou as they had rifle shells, and their pickup would only take six or eight caribou, and they would say they were going to bring others out to pick them up, and you knew that was never going to happen.

At the end of the 19th century, around the tail end of the Klondike Gold Rush, the chief ofFirst Nations band warned against the overhunting of the Forty Mile caribou herd as a food source for local Indigenous communities that was then feeding an influx of hungry miners.Estimates of the herd’s population in 1920 put the number of forty-mile caribou as high as 568,000 animals. Just a decade later, that number dropped to roughly 10,000. By 1973, the herd hit a historic low of just 5,740 caribou. By limiting them as a food source for the natives,limiting commercial hunting for guides, and total ban onthe other hunting communitiesfor twenty years as well as wolf bounty, the numbers have increased to over 80,000 animals.It is a delicate balance in handling the way that the caribou are harvested.

I carried my personal rifle with me on patrol as we hadtwo cars and only one detachmentrifle that was kept at the Detachment for the use of the other four members if required. I drove the old Chevrolet station wagon that was equipped with a radio that was good for about 20 miles. It had s “STOP light on the right front fender that could be activated to flash for an overtake and attempt to stop a vehicle and a big cherry on the centreof the roof near the front.The wolves used the road to travel between the valleys to hunt and were car smart enough that when a car came along, they would leave the road and wait until the car passed and then come back on the road and continue their travel to the next valley.You would sometimes see packs of wolves of up to fifteen members.

I devised a plan when I saw a pack of wolves that I would wind up there.I put the car in neutral and coast to a stop, trying to duplicate the noise of a vehicle continuingon up the road.The wolves would be off in the bush and not see the vehicle stopped.As the vehicle sound was no longer audible, they would return to theroad to continue their track to the next valley.I would very quietly get onto the top of the station wagon. get into the sleepingbag with all my winter clothes on.Even though the temperature was -50 degrees Fahrenheit,there was a certain amount of heat coming through the roof of the car, so I could stay there for a considerable time and wait for them to return to the ploughed roadway.The plastic domeof the lightwas just the right height to rest the forestock of the rifle on and with the padded portion of the sleeping bag to help steady it.Then wait for them to come back out on the road and try shooting them using the round rotating plastic light as my rifle rests.It worked,but a lot of the shooting started a 200 yards, and wolves would head into the bush. By the time I shot a couple of them, they were outwards to 300 and 400 yards, and they never seemed to run in a straight line.

I revised my plan a little.When I spotted the wolf pack up the road, I would speed upand could cut down the distance to where they went off the road and into the bush.I would then put the carin neutral, turn offthe ignition, and let itdriveslowly to a stop.That way, the wolves would hear a decreasing noise and then silence as if the vehicle had departed.Then, very quietly, Iput my rifle and sleeping bag on the roof of the station wagon,got up on the bumper and fender area of the hood, and crawled into the sleeping bag on the roof.There was enough heat coming from the inside of the carthrough the roof that it was quite comfortableto spend a considerable time waiting for them to come back onto the road.There was a considerable amount of snow that winter, so they were going in on one track, and they just reversed in the trail and came back out onto the roadway to go to the next valley topredate the larger animals in the next valley.

This one pack of fifteen came out onto the road. Along with their leader, they all had beenjust lookingat the silent vehicle sitting just a hundred yardsaway. The leader was a huge wolf,head and shoulders abovethe rest of them, and he was the firstone that I shot. There was a lot of hesitation from not getting any messages from the leader.Then, four other wolves that started running away from the riflewent to wolf heaven.I reloaded, andI got two more of the fifteen of them.I weighed the leader on the government scales, and he weighed 180 pounds.I pulled them off the road and covered them with snow so they would freeze well.And I didnot get any blood on the inside of the vehicle.Icame back an hour later after I finishedmy patrol, loaded them all into the station wagon, and returned to the Detachment.

The sun does not come over the horizon for over a month, so it is just semi-light conditions that hamper good visibility forlong shots.In good light that Winchester .264 Magnum and the 3 to–9 power scope, I could put ten rounds in a five-inch aluminum pie place at five hundred yards.In the winter, we had over 400 miles of roads that were maintained in the winter, andwe had to patrol the area as it was -50 below in case someone broke down in the cold,and we had to check on the miners that worked their claims with tunnels down topay dirt and then sluice it out when the spring waters returned.

I placed the wolves out on the laneway to take some pictures, and others came along and took pictures as well.It was my intention to turn them over to the local natives whowere in need, and they could collect the bounty,they could skin them out, and sell the hides or use them for trimming parkas that some of the women sewed.I stored them in the Forestry warehouse.Being a member of the RCMP our Rules and Regulations stated that you were restricted to only $75.00 of money for fur In each year.



About a week later, I got a call from the Commanding Officer in Whitehorse, and he stated that somebody had sent that picture of me out to the American Press.And every “wolf lover” in North America wasup in arms and wanted a piece of meand hishide, and Ottawa Headquarters was rattling this chain.He told me that the only way that Iwas going to save myass, and especially his,wasby personally going to skin them out.Sendlots of pictures to the press and then send the hides out the the big fur auction in Winnipeg.When the hides are sold I wouldbe turning the money over to the local women’s “stitch and bitch” club in Dawson City as well as the bounty money and get as much press as Icouldorganize.

My next couple of weeks were spent thawing those stinking wolves out, skinning, salting, and stretching the hides out.Then packing them up and shipping them out to Winnipeg.I shipped them out to a taxidermist friend in Winnipeg and put him in charge of taking pictures and involving the press.I told him that he could buy what he wanted from the fur market because I filled him in on what I had been directed to do by my Officer Commanding, and I promised to send him a couple of the Yukon wolves out to him free of charge that he could mount and sell for his troubles.He bought the hide of the 180-pound male wolf for a big price and got some good pictures out to the press.I had already had him do a head-mounted rug of several animals:a wolf, wolverine, lynx, Artic white fox, martin, fisher, beaver, and muskrat, and a full mount of a weasel. He mounted several polar bears and a white wolf for relatives and friends as well for me..I went on hunting without any picture taking that could be sent out to the press, and all of the dust seemed to settle.With all the bounty moneyand money from the sale of the furs in Winnipeg, I was able to turn $11,000 to the local church ladies' group with lots of pictures to the press, and nothing further was heard from the Wolf Lovers league.

 When it warmed up after the 17th of March, I made a cross-country ski trip down into the Sixty Mile River from the “top of the world highway” to check on the wolf conditions in that area.It was an easy glide along to the top ofthe valley going down, and with binoculars, I spotted a pack of 13 wolves killing a moose. If the moose challenged them and did not run then they were left alone.If they ran, they were dragged down by biting the hindlegs until they went down in the snow, and the wolves literally ate them alive and went on to attack another moose.I did not go into the valley but just skied along the top of the valley, and I did not shoot any of those wolvesas I had no way of getting them up out of the valley, and it was not a pleasant site to watch them ham string the moose and eat the nose off and leave them to die and do it repeatedly but watched them takedown five moose in a matter of five hours. I fired at them when they confronted a cow with two calves and scared them away from them.I then had five hours of uphill skiing back to the car.Before the winter was out, I had done my part in reducing the wolf population, and I had killed 26 wolves.I volunteered to work all of the day shifts doing these long patrols over the 300 miles of roads that were maintained.
