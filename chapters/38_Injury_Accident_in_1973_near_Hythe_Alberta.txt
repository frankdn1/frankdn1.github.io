We had a report of a bog burning about five miles north of Hythe, Alberta and the Beaverlodge Detachment requested assistance from the Grande Prairie Highway Patrol to assist in controlling traffic through the area.They had more than 40 cars and trucks that were in the ditch about a quarter of a mile from the fire.The major concern was a semi-trailer of propane that was overturned in the ditch in that smoky area.There was little or no wind, and the visibility was zero for over a mile. I responded there shortly after 6:00 p.m. and took the north end of the smoky area.We would usually pick a truck to lead the way through the smoke so they could look down through the smoke and follow the centre line through the curved section of the highway, and a number of cars and pickups would be allowed to follow.We had one wrecker that the driver had oxygen equipment that would follow the flow of one-way traffic and he would pull one of the vehicles out of the ditch and tow it to the end of the smoke.When he got to the end of the smoke, then a reversal of the flow of traffic would be repeated, and he would haul another vehicle out of the ditch.They arranged to borrow the oxygen tanks from the Hospital in Hythe to keep the tow truck driver supplied with oxygen.

At about eleven o’clock, a chap approached me. He was a victim of an impaired driver whohad run intohim and his vehicle, and the court case was pending in a few days.He had hitch-hiked down from Whitehorse to give evidence at the trial that was one of my files.I invited him to sit in the Police car, and I would be relieved at midnight, and I would give him a ride to Grande Prairie.I had used up all of my flares and was sitting with the emergency lights going on the side of the highway.I had a big line of vehicles stopped, and as another vehicle approached, I would move forward and explain to the next vehicle how we were handling the traffic and advise that we still had about 20 vehicles still in the ditch and the danger of the propane tanker overturned in the ditch.

The next vehicle that came along was a cattle truck hauler.It stopped, and I got up on the side of the truck and explained the routine ofhow we were handling the flow of traffic.I got down from the side of the truck and, went to the back of his vehicle and inspected the lights on the rear of the truck.I got back up and explained to him that when the traffic northbound came through and to wait for the tow truck with a vehicle attached, then he could lead the flow of traffic through the smoke and follow the centre line on the highway.The truck, obviously, and a vacuum assist on the clutch and brakes as he was grinding gears.I noticed that there was another set of headlights coming a good four or five miles up the highway.I got back up on the side of the highway and told him to take his foot off the brake and wait a few minutes for the compressor to catch up, and just as I stepped down, I was struck by the front of a cab over a semi-trailer.I was looking at the side of the headlight right at my face and going down the ice-covered highway.

The trucker had slowed to what he called the double nickels (55 MPH) when he saw the emergency lights of the police car,the brake lights ahead of him, and then just tail lights;he continued at his double nickels speed until he realized the vehicle ahead was stopped.He braked and managed to steer his truck past the back of the truck, but his loaded semi-trailer went into the back left corner of the truck and sent it off into the ditch.I was knocked about ten feet forward and was sliding along on the icy surface and then fell down, and I could see the right front wheel coming towards me, and I kicked at it, and it ran over my feet, and I grabbed at the tire as I knew the same wheels were coming up and the tire caught my sand brown belt and stuffed me up into the fender well and I was looking at the back of the headlight.I was covered with diesel fuel as the back of the cattle truck hit the fuel tanks and burst the tank on the right side of the semi.I was still conscious and the trucker was standing at the front of thetruck.

Whenever someone would come back to see what had happened, he would say that I ran over the poor son of a bitch of a policeman, and they would go off looking in the ditch, and the next stopped driver would arrive, and he would repeat the same dialogue.He must repeat that a dozen times.I had got my wind back and was struggling, trying to get back off the top of the tire and slightly jammed into the wheel well.The truck had been shut off but I had trouble with the hot manifold burning my lower leg and finally got wiggled back out.My flashlight and hat wereon the highway by the side of the truck.I obviously was in shock, and I retrievedthem and put my hat on my head, and went to the front of the truck, and the driver said to me, “I drove over the poor son of a bitch”.I said that “I was the poor son of a bitch that you run over, and I did not appreciate challenging my mother’s marriage.” 

I went to the police car and had my passenger get in the driver’s seat;I got into the passenger seat, got on the radio, and advised that I was struck by the semi-trailer and needed some medical treatment and would go to the hospital in Hythe for treatment and the relief person could take my position on the north end and to follow the tow truck through the smoke.When the member arrived, we led the procession through the smoke, and I continued on to the Hythe hospital as I was leaking from several cuts and wounds.

The doctor asked me if I had been fighting with a grizzly bear and lost, and I told him it was a cab over Kenworth that I was fighting and lost that round.Hedid some ex-rays on my feet and ankles and thought he could see a few cracked bones on my toes and both my feet, and totalled nearly 100 sutures and treated the burns where my socks were, and the diesel oil had heated and burned the skin a little from the white-hot manifold that I touched when wiggling trying to get out of the fender well.I talked to the doctor a lot to get him to agree to let me go to the Grande Prairie Hospital,as I was going to Grande Prairie in a Police car with radio communication, and he finally agreed.

When I got to the Detachment, the dumb Sgt insisted that I go into the office and advise Peace River of being involved in an accident, which I did on crutches.We then drove to my witness's parents' place and dropped him off, and as It was near my residence, I decided to drop off my duty belt and revolver and change out of the blood-stained uniform.My wife was asleep, and when she woke, she wanted to know why I was taking off my uniform as I thought you had to work until 4:00 a.m.I told her that I had been hit by a truck and was going to change and go the Grande Prairie Hospital if I could get my pants off and another uniform back on.She helped me with both, and I related what happened and that I already had been checked out with a doctor and patched up pretty good at the Hythe Hospital.I drove to the hospital and took the x-ray plates inwith me.

The doctors examined them and told me that they had no room available at the hospital and they could only put me up with a bed in the hallway.He asked ifI had an easy chair at home, and I responded in the positive.He said he would confine me to that chair for a week and, if I could feel any pains worsening, then call an ambulance and come back to the hospital in case some of my internal organs got damaged.I advised the office that the Police car was at my residence and that there wereno rooms available at the Hospital, and I was sent home by a doctor.Eleven days later, I went back to work.
