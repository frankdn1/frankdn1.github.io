Arriving in Dawson City, I was there for about half an hour after I arrived and was sent out to investigate a hit and run where a boy riding a bicycle had been struck by a vehicle and was injured.I located the vehicle and arrested the impaired driver.He got a month's sentence, and the stupid judge said he was to serve his time in the RCMP cells in Dawson City.That meant we had a night guard, and the day shift had to guard the prisoner.The other married member would have him digging his garden and cutting the lawn when he was working days.

I had him working with me when we refurbished the RCMP cemetery.I made all new headboards.We had a big supply of 2 x 10s in the warehouse, so I glued them together, rounded the top, routered in the detail of the member and regimental number and date of death, and painted the headboards white with black lettering.I replaced the broken wooden picket fence with a short chain-link fence around the entire graveyard.

We then hauled white-colored gravel in the back of the Detachment station wagon from up the creeks for the walkways areas and black gravel for over the individual graves.I made a big new sign complete with the RCMP crest for over the entrance to the cemetery and painted it up as best I could.I introduced a new thing in an Indian's life that he had never experienced in his 40 years of life, and that was-- -- -- work.

I found an abandoned single-cylinder engine that was in the dump. It had three-foot wheels on each side, and they were almost four inches thick.I tried turning it over, and it was not seized, and I welded a big splitting axe head onto the outside of one of the wheels. And a similar block of iron on the other wheel on the opposite side of the frame work of the other wheel to balance it off.I bought a new magneto from the hardware store, put some kerosene in the fuel tank, cleaned the spark plug, and it started on the third rotation of the big wheels.It had about ten revolutions per minute at its slowest speed.I welded up a really heavy metal framework that the splitting axe went through that sloped away from where the axe went through.I built a set of skids and a base so that I could pull it around town from wood pile to wood pile with the Police station wagon.All you had to do was put the end of the block against the wheel after the axe went past, and then you stood well back because there was no way you could control where the two pieces of wood where going to fly.I have no idea how many cords of wood we will cut for everyone in town in the next couple of weeks.I understand that it remained in service for five or six years after I left until someone from the Workmanâ€™s Compensation came there on holiday, and it was immediately retired to the Museum.

It was hot work because in the summer in Dawson City, it gets into the low 90s on the Fahrenheit scale, and the sun does not go down for over two months. I put a lot more effort into it than I needed to and kept bugging him to keep up with me as we had to shovel the gravel into the back of the station wagon onto a big tarp and then shovel it off into the wheel barrel and then move it to where we needed it within the cemetery.We then got to paint all the buildings on the compound and all of the wooden sidewalks around the compound that we built.We painted the outside of the Detachment boat, and then we varnished the inside of the 26-foot canoe.We then painted a lot of the wooden sidewalks on the main street in town.

Then, we split wood for all of the seniors with our mechanized wood splitter that I built.We went out and cut a lot of trees, and I had one of the local truckers haul it in when we loaded it for him, and he dumped it around the settlement, and we cut and split that as well for Native residents living in Dawson.He ended up with his own wood business after the six-month sentence was served.I befriended him and was on several trips where he was hired on as the cook for a local prospector (our night guard as well).

I have competed in all sorts of shooting competitions and represented the force when we did the competition shooting with the Alaska State Police.Four of us would be chosen every other year to travel to Alaska to compete. Bill McQuirter, Bill Henderson, Mike Dwernichuk, and I were on one trip to Anchorage.It was not fair competition because we had to compete with their "drinking team" as well.They were composed of their "vice squad," and when we arrived at about six of their drinking establishments, their show of the evening went on, and drinks were served on the house.This went on until well after midnight.We had to be on the range at 9:00 a.m., and we still beat their shooting team.When they came to Whitehorse the next year, we still beat their scores as well, as it continued the next year in Fairbanks.

I have six certificates signed by different Commissioners for shooting "possibles" (ten rounds cutting the 'CX' in the middle of the bulls-eye) with rifle and revolver in my 33 + years of annual shoots, so I sort of know where to place the bullets.I was on the "Sniper - Counter sniper" team, and you had to submit a "Crow" target shot at 200 yards every second week, or you were off the team.That was before ERT teams (Emergency Response Teams)were formed.

I won the Eastern Provincial trap and skeet competition in Halifax, and the price was a fully carved German Shotgun for trap and a Beretta"Pirelli" for the skeet prize (which I still have), and it has never been fired.After I won that competition, I was interviewed on TV and questioned how I hadwon the competition with a fully choked semi-automatic shotgun.I gave credit to "Browning" forproducing the best weapons and said that I had three other "Brownings" to boast about as well.

About three weeks later, in the mail, I received a gold replica of the Browning shotgun as a tie tack.



I have a 10" barrelled .357 S&W revolver for doing silhouette shooting, and you have a pig and turkey-sized metal targets out to 200 yards for that.I had the idea that I was going to understudy Cpl. Brown, our armorer in Depot, as I had taken a few gun-smithing courses and built my own revolver from a block of steel, they provided that shoots .22 shorts, and I have built up several rifles over the years, one I still have.It is a bull-barrelled 219 Zipper Improved. I have 40 shotguns, rifles, revolvers, and pistols in my collection; a lot of them are collectibles.I, at one time, had a complete Winchester rifle collection of every make, model and caliber that Winchester ever made, and I sold it off quite a few years back.I still do some archery, and I gave up serious hunting for a big game about fifteen years ago because there is a lot of chewing on a moose for two people, and it seems our freezers are always full, and there is no room for wild game.I would not have to go very far to bag one because they are regular visitors to our yard and the subdivision.

I do most of my hunting with a camera now.I have a Nikon COOLPIX P1000 camera that has a CMOS collection system, and the lens goes from 24 - 3,000mm hand, so you can get up close and personal with most everything.I have a Sky-Watcher "Star Adventurer" attachment that you put on your tripod. Dial up your latitude,focus it on "Polaris,"the North Star, and attach your camera to it. When you turn on the electric motor that is inside the unit, it looks after the counter-rotation of the earth, and all of the sky and the Universe are still.The people at the equator are spinning along at 1000 miles an hour where we are at this latitude of 52063 degrees north and just doing about 500 mph.I do quite a bit of cosmic photography with it, as well as bird watching.It is the best point and shoot camera that was ever invented.

 Take a look at the website on the Internet, "Sky-watcher Photo Gallery," and you will see what you can produce.They have a really slow server and hundreds of pictures, and you have a choice of planets or solar systems, so set up the download and go for coffee.I have forwarded several of my pictures but none of them have made the gallery yet as they are opening a separate section for cameras as it is a new popular medium.Most of them are using a telescope with a camera or computer attached, and I am in the category of just a camera because of the big magnification of the lens.

At about 1,000 mm, you get a full-frame picture of the moon, and at 2,000mm, you get about a quarter of the moon, and then at 3,000mm, you are looking inside a crater and see the shadow of a mountain on the side of the crater.You can go onto digital settings, and it multiplies it in sets of two and three times so you can go to 6,000 mm. and then 9,000 mm. At 6,000 mm, you only get about three craters on the moon in a full-frame image.I showed the local chaps at the observatory of the volcanic action on the moon, and he told me that the moon did not have any volcanoes and it was inert until I showed him my photograph with the shadow of the volcano on the side of one of the craters as well as lava flows in one other area.He asked if he could have a copy of the pictures. I turned the camera over to him, and he copied it onto his computer.

When I got home, I discovered he had deleted all of the pictures that I had on my camera.The very next day, he was being interviewed on the CBC, and he gave credit for the pictures to a local amateur photographer, and he took credit for discovering volcanic action on the moon.I can duplicate the pictures, but I have to have the right phase of the moon the catch the shadow of the volcano and, of course, a clear night, but that has not happened in the past four to five months.

We live on a three-acre, mostly treed property in a subdivision about 4 miles southeast of Sherwood Park and six miles east of Edmonton in a house that I built all by myself, with my wife hauling the materials in our Volvo station wagon and trailer.I did everything except shingle the roof, and that was the only contractor that I had on the property.With being forever mobile with the Force, I built it big to be in the marketplace if it was to be saleable, and with the three floors and the four-car garage, we have 4,400 square feet under the roof.My wife and I rattle around by ourselves and a miniature long-haired Dachshund in a four-bedroom, four-bathroom facility with two fireplaces.That all got started 47 years ago. 

With being on an acreage, there is no end to the ideas that you can get involved in. I have a wood working shop in the basement with a dust collection system with every tool possible.I have a full metal working and welding shop in the garage with MIG, TIG, Arc, Oxy/Acetylene, and now Plasma.I have cut-off saws and a metal lathe with all the attachments, and if I cannot fix it, repair it, or build it better, it is time for a trip for you to the dump. With the kids gone off to follow their careers, our garage has turned into a two-car crowded garage and my complete metal working shop and small engine repair shop.I have built 19 trailers and modified 26 other hard-topped camper trailers to make utility trailers as well. I have built 13 hydraulic wood splitters, and I have lost track of all the other things that I have built since I retired 30 years ago.

I used to do tree trimming and falling, and I gave that up mostly about five years ago.I build fences and decks and steps and have built garages and wood sheds.I do a lot of bird watching and we have 25 feeders around the property and have a great variety of birds come to the feeders as I feed year around.We have eight peanut butter feeders right in front of our kitchen window hanging down from the facia, each with 24 holes, and it is a constant flight of birds that you can sit at the window, and they are just about a foot and a half away getting snacks.I don't go to the bar or smoke, but I spend my mad money on bird and squirrel seeds.

 Jantje has 30flower gardens around the property, and she entertains herself with that most of the summer.I rotor till a plot, and she runs at with another variety of flowers or roses or ornamental trees.This past year, we have gone into raised beds, and I have built a few of them in the area as well, and we are getting too old to bend over.We have some trouble with the moose and deer as they are a real problem in the area because there is a whole section (one square mile) of mostly treed property directly across the road from us. 

For my 70th birthday present, my wife bought me a Polaris "Ranger 400" side-by-side ATV with a heated cab.I have built it up to do my snow clearing.I did it with Cub Cadet garden tractors with chains and blades before that.I did it with a snow blower for about ten years and I got sick of a couple hours of walking in a blizzard with half my wardrobe on.The Polaris is a side-by-side heated cab, and I have installed a winch and a 78" blade that I have stabilized between the frame at the front and pushing from the rear hitch with a 2" square tubing running to the back.It takes me about five minutes to clear my driveway and turn around.So to further entertain myself, I do a mile of the subdivision road and 42 driveways and turn-arounds.I can be back in the house in about four hours if I hurry in the comfort of the heated cab and if I don't get invited in for coffee or a drink.With the blade angled and about 25 mph, I can send the snow off the roadway almost over to the fence.The Polaris was into its 10th season with very little maintenance, and I got about eight hours out of five gallons of fuel and a lot of Bailies for my coffee and a lot of other treats and credit cards for fuel.A few of the driveways are half a mile long, and some of the turnarounds are for the water trucks and a huge area.

This summer, I had Polaris upgraded to a "Brutus"model with a three-cylinder diesel with hydrostatic drive and all hydraulic lift front end and hydraulically drive P.T.O. (power take-off) that they have 19 different attachments that you can put on this machine.The story about the new machine is rather amusing.My neighbor, who has a landscaping business, came over to show off his new Polaris "Brutus" ATV that he had bought second-hand for his business.He had the blade attachment and moved left and right and up and down and was able to slope it for grading.He also had a 65-inch mower deck and brush sweeper that worked off the P.T.O.Polaris had been approached by "Bob Cat" engineers in 2013, and they wanted to engineer a four-wheel drive machine that did not tear up the turf as their units did that would accommodate their present line of attachments, which resulted in the "Brutus" hydraulics and front and rear suspension being designed by Bobcat.

I was totally impressed with how well it was made, how solid the hydraulics were on the front end, the heavy metal used for the lift mechanism, and the quick attachment for changing attachments. I was explaining all the added features of the insulated cab, defrost system, power steering, tilt steering wheel, air conditioning, powered lift on the dump box on the back, wipers, windshield washer, high and low headlights, and LED tail lights and brake lights and the "joy stick" that controlled the blade to my wife.I had just finished servicing my Polaris "Ranger 400" and sort of put it away in our cold storage shed for the summer. My neighbor came over to see if I wanted to go with him to the Polaris dealer in Wetaskiwin, as they had a forklift attachment listed for sale on Kajjii that he was going to purchase.

Unbeknown to me my wife had approached him and told him to keep an eye out for another one of the Brutus models so she could buy it for my 80th birthday present.I was tied up with another project, and when he came back with the set of forklifts, he gave my wife a quote for a brand new 2016 Polaris Brutus with blade and snow blower that they had in stock.She phoned and told them to put it on hold, and she went to the bank and got a certified check and came back and gave it to me and told me to go and pick up my 80th birthday present, which I willingly headed out.

When the Brutus was complete, they sent one with a load of attachments to every one of their Canadian dealerships.They found that there were no Terrain Vehicle drivers with deep enough pockets to afford one and could see no need for any of the attachments, so they were not really saleable items. So, by 2016, they were no longer available in Canada, and they only sold them to the larger cities and the American army.My Brutus has only been used to clear the snow on the dealership's parking lot and driveway with the blade for the past four winters and had 53 hours on it.They would only sell it with the blade, machine and snow blower, so we got a major brake on the total cost of the machine and attachments.

I had better give up this rattle of thoughts, or you will figure that I am the biggest braggart you ever met or heard of.I have lots more things that I have done in my life, so I have lots to write about.I have over 300 hours recorded below 60 feet with SKUBA and have been poking a hole in the air, suspended on wings for over 60 years since I got my license. I have just under 7,000 hours recorded and checked out on 19 different aircraft, the biggest twin was a DC-3 and I have 50 hours of training to fly a helicopter.I owned my own aircraft for 9 1/2 years and flew it all over the North.The longest cross-country trip I have done is from Fort McPherson, NWT, to my home town of Coldwater, Ontario.Before I got back to Fort McPherson I had just over 10,000 miles under the wings.With all of my life experiences and the 33+ years with the RCMP I have a few chapters in my book to be filled in.
