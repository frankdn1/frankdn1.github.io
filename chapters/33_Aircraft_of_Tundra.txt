As an explanation of the geographical location that I continue to refer to as Coppermine, I feel that I have to explain some of the confusion to keep you abreast of the changes that we encountered.I was stationed there as the number two man from September 1969 until July of 1971, although the government decided to change all of the geographic locations where there were settlements and not the other known and named places.I had difficulty relating the Intuit names as all the mapping had not caught up to the name changes to become familiar enough with them to identify what place they were referring to with the new name.I could not spell some of the names and had difficulty pronouncing them, let alone remembering the old name to geographically locate that settlement, so you will have to bear with me using the old name of Coppermine.

Now, it is named Kuglugtuk, and to help you geographically locate it, it is still situated west of the mouth of the Coppermine River on the mainland of the Arctic coast, overlooking the Coronation Gulf as part of the Arctic Ocean. The hamlet changed its name in 1996 to Kugluktuk, which means "place of rapids," referring to the rapids at Bloody Falls, 15 km upstream on the Coppermine River.To further confuse the reader, they divided the Northwest Territories into two separate territories, and the easterly portion put Kuglugtuk in the Nunavut area, with the N.W.T. border just west of there.It had a population of about 1200 people when I was stationed there.The traditional language was Inuinnaqutun, which is written in the Latin alphabet to add to the confusion. Thanks to the Catholic fathers who filtered north in the mid-1800s, Intuit spoke six languages across the North, each having as many as three dialects.Across the eastern Arctic, it is written in Syllabic symbols, but the majority of younger Intuit all speak and understand English.

We had Akalavik on the west side of the Mackenzie delta, and they wanted to build an airport and needed gravel for roads; the airport base on that side of the delta is just delta mud, where they were going to build an airport on the east side of the delta where they had lots of gravel.Then, on July 18, 1958, it became Inuvik, which means "Place of Man" in the local Inuvialuktun language, officially began by proclamation of the 15th session of the Council of N.W.T.Inuvik was the first planned town North of the Arctic Circle.Where Aklavik was known as the first to be known as (Ak≈Çarvik) (from the Inuvialuktun, meaning - (barren ground grizzly place), it was established as a trapping and trading centre because of the rich muskrat fur harvesting in the late 1800s; with a population of over 1,500, the community served as the Regional Administrative Centre for the Territorial Government.

Building conditions at the time were considered to be unsuitable because of the delta mud, and no gravel was known to exist within a reasonable distance from the community, aggravated by the permafrost in the area.With a bit of rain, it became a sea of slippery, sticky slime and deep ruts from the vehicle traffic, and when it dried, the dust stayed in the air for an hour from a vehicle traveling down the street.

Back to my story:

In the late spring of 1970, the manager of the Coppermine Co-Op had asked if I would take a flight south up the Coppermine River to look for some moose and see if we could locate where the caribou herds were located south of settlement for the benefit of the co-op members. I was always looking for an excuse to head out of the settlement with my aircraft and agreed to take him on a trip.It was a nice sunny Saturday morning as the sun had returned above the horizon after its three-month sojourn, and the temperature was just -20 below zero Fahrenheit. I had figured I had four hours of fuel on board, and the Coppermine River was wide and meandering, with dozens of rivers and creeks coming into the river on both sides.About a hundred miles south, it began to get very narrow and turned into more or less a canyon, and it was not likely moose pasture much beyond that point, so with a few short side trips, I had estimated that we would be back before darkness again prevailed.I had checked the weather and was anticipating another week of the same conditions with no storms forecast, so we would be flying south into the low sun, and the sky was clear of any clouds as far as I could see.In aerodynamic terms, it is called CAVU (Ceiling And Visibility Unlimited). 

I had difficulty with my aircraft on skies out at the airport after they had recently ploughed the drifts off the airstrip and the gravel strips; when your aircraft was on the skies, it made it difficult on the skis for takeoffs and quite dangerous when landing.Another reason I had chosen to put the aircraft down on the sea ice of the Coronation Gulf was that the Eskimo kids had visited my aircraft (according to the size of the mukluk tracks in the snow, and I figured there had been four of them).They must have figured that my aircraft was their own candy store and had cleaned out almost all of my emergency food supply.I figured that I carried about a week's supply of groceries in dried meat and dried foodstuff, chocolate bars and high energy bars, even a small bottle of lard, tea bags, a hot chocolate mix, and "Freshy"to take the taste off of even swamp water.I had a self-stacking frying pan, small pots, lots of candles, .22 shells, and my survival Browning semi-automatic take-down rifle with a scope.I had a small fuel canister stove that fit inside the pot that was used for making tea and hot chocolate. I had two sleeping bags and a double-layered Arabian silk tent that would accommodate two people for shelter, and it only weighed two pounds.I had it all secured in a packsack underneath the rear seat.The sleeping bags had their own canvas bags with straps. I had replenished survival food after I moved the aircraft down onto the sea ice.

Another reason for moving the aircraft off the airport runway was to do with flying with skis on the aircraft, as you have no brakes.You just slide along until all that kinetic energy is dissipated from the weight of the aircraft and your landing speed.With hard-packed snow on the 5,000-foot runway, there is very little friction created until the lift of the wings and ground effect are dissipated and the weight of the aircraft comes down on the skis.The runway has a good layer of gravel built up, so it was flat and level, and the six or so feet of it as not to thaw the permafrost below and getting the aircraft back up onto the runway sometimes proved difficult when it continued on off the end of the built-up area and off into the tundra that had a slope towards the ocean.

Another reason for moving the aircraft down onto the sea ice is that I would have abetter chance of seeing and possibly catching the delinquents if they were to visit my aircraft again because it was very visible from most of the settlement.The airport was up on a hill about five miles out of the settlement, and locating the aircraft down onto the sea ice was within comfortable walking distance from my residence.I had prepared anchors drilled into the ice and frozen in to secure the aircraft when it was parked.It was a flat, clear area of unbroken ice of the Coronation Gulf of the Arctic Ocean that extended for miles along the shore with no snow cover. That strip of ice was the back of a string of islands that extended about 20 miles parallel to the shoreline and never developed open water cracks from the tidal action.It was about a mile wide from shore to the islands that rose a couple hundred feet from the sea.These islands were a part of a basalt rift that extended repeatedly across most of the tundra area south of Coppermine.The reason is that there was no snow on the ice in that higher as they got closer to the settlement.

I had flown the aircraft down onto the sea ice and parked it off the alignment of the commercial ice strip in front of the settlement.I had made anchors in the ice to tie the aircraft down as it was an area that was totally clear of any snow cover and polished clear ice for hundreds of yards in every direction.I had placed short willow branches in the ice, setting out a temporary runway that was usually into the wind so that I would provide some depth perception for landings on the polished surface.What happens in still water or, in this case, shiny ice surface? You have the sky reflected on the surface, and until you are right at the surface of the water or ice, you cannot judge the distance accurately for a round-out to land smoothly.With poor depth perception, you could be on the surface still coming down at your rate of decent, or, worse;you could round out anticipating the contact with the surface when you were still fifty to a hundred feet in the air and spin into the ground.I had also placed a largenumber of juice cans with rolls of toilet paper and dampened with diesel with plastic lids so they could be set alight in the event of my need or any other aircraft to land when it was dark.They all provided more depth of perception a lot further back when making an approach to land. 

The big ice airstrip located directly in front of the settlement had battery-powered lights that allowed the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft to land when they were delivering fuel for the settlement.When the "fuel lift" was finished, the lights went with them for their next assignment.A big D-8 Cat had ploughed that airstrip with a cable blade to remove the snow, and it left quite high snow banks with big blocks of crusted snow on both sides of the runway, and there were snow banks along the entire length.There was just room for the Hercules to turn at the end, where they pulled off to transfer the fuel out of the bladders that carried the fuel in the fuselage of the aircraft.

My aircraft had an insulated engine cover that extended to the ice surface, and a bit and wing covers had been put on the wings to prevent frost crystals from forming on the metal wings that would dramatically affect the efficiency of the wings to develop lift.It also made it really easy to move snow off the wings if it had snowed.I had made a means of warming the engine with what I had named "The Poor Man's Herman Nelson," which I modified from a Volkswagen van gasoline heater and set it up it to blow heat into the cowling and warm the aircraft engine and battery.It was a gas-fired heater that worked quite well.I took some time getting the engine up to temperature as it was -20 F, and there was about a 20 - 25 mph wind, so I kept my heater company until I got some engine temperature on the gauges.

With the engine up to temperature and the battery quite warm, I started the engine and allowed it to warm up. I talked to the local Department of Transport office on the radio and notified them of our intended flight, and they could open my flight plan when I flew past the D.O.T. office on my flight south. 

After I ran up the engine, I decided to check in at home, phone the co-op manager, and tell him to meet me on the plane in about fifteen minutes. We were all ready to head out to look for moose and caribou.When I got to my residence, our four-year-old daughter Sherry was all dressed and wanted to go outside to play.My wife queried me about how long I had anticipated being away.I told her that we should be back in a couple of hours.She suggested that Sherry would enjoy going on an airplane ride, and I reluctantly agreed to take her with me on that airplane ride.I decided to take the Ski-doo as I had Sherry with me, and it was a long way for a four-year-old to walk. I then picked up the Co-op Manager en route and went down to the aircraft.I did a full inspection and "walked around the aircraft," checking the fuel caps on the top of the wings and all the controls for freedom. I untied the rope from the anchor in the ice on the left wing, and a left rope was tied on the right wing hard point on the wing.I retied the knot so it would come undone by pulling the slack end of the rope.The ropes were left attached to the wing for convenience as they took up very little drag when in flight.

The rope on the left wing hard point was left tied to the anchor in the ice.It was much longer, and the knot was tied so that it could be pulled and released when you were inside the aircraft cabin.I started up the engine and let it get up to temperature again, checked the mags and all the instrumentation, and set the altimeter right at the true to sea level. I then revved the engine to take the aircraft forward while still anchored on the right wing.It went in a slight circle, and I managed to go forward enough to get the skis off the little blocks I had underneath the skies and prevent them from freezing into the ice.When I let off the throttle, the aircraft slowly rotated back past facing into the wind and went 90 degrees around until the side of the aircraft was facing against the wind.My passenger (not being a pilot) pulled the rope, and the knot came off the anchor.We slowly started to slide sideways downwind.I tried applying some prop speed, and that increased the speed of our sideways slide.

I think what was happening was the wind, now blowing at about 30 mph, had a high-pressure area along the entire right side of the fuselage and tail area, and the prop was increasing a low pressure by blowing the air alongside the fuselage and tail.I tried taking the prop rpm up twice more, and our sideways drift increased both times.We sat going sideways, and I figured it was not all that bad because there were scattered snow patches closer to shore, and that would surely slow our sideway drift, and I would physically be able to turn the aircraft into wind when we stopped going sideways.

That was not going to be the case, because the left ski caught a crack in the ice, and we came to an abrupt, complete halt.We tilted heavily, and the left wing went down against the ice with the flat of the dihedral at the end of the wing on the ice.When it righted itself, the rubber suspense of the landing gear popped the left ski out of the crack. Slowly, it returned to our sideways drift until we started to contact small patches of snow that were scattered randomly on the ice surface. We were going backward with the direction of the wind to the wind, and then one ski would catch a patch of snow under one ski, and we would go around in tight circles until we would catch another random patch of snow, and it invariably ended up with us still going downwind.

After almost a mile into the bay, we encountered rough river ice, and it finally came to a stop.I had shut down the engine with the idea of getting out and maybe hanging onto the tail so we could better direct our path that was not sideways.When we finally came to a complete stop, we were still facing downwind.I got out and went around to inspect the end of the wing, and there was not even a mark on the new paint, so it had not been contacted the ice before the aircraft went back to level and onto the other ski when we hit that crack.I inspected the bungee cord suspension and had my passenger rock wings up and down to ensure the suspension was in good order. I rocked the wing a few times up and down on both sides, and it was solid. Then, I checked the tail section.Before I got into the aircraft, I got up and checked the filler cap on the right wing.

During its lifetime, it has been used as a flight instruction aircraft as it has dual controls, a dual instrument panel, and dual rudder peddles.It had a channel radio, compass and I had installed a radio compass that you could also tune into local AM and F.M. radio stations, as well as a sun compass for the extended 24-hour daylight for flying in the daylight (when it was not overcast) during the extended 24-hour daylight for over nine months of the summer, at the Latitude where I was stationed.With the sun compass, you have to have a very accurate watch because the sun goes around the horizon in the north and back up into the sky in the southern quadrant.With not knowing the exact time from the charts that came with the sun compass, your tract could be four or five degrees.If you are flying out 100 miles, you could miss your destination by 30 miles with just a few minutes of error.I had no great need of an ILS (instrument landing system), which is a radio navigation system that provides short-range guidance to the aircraft to allow you to approach the airport at night or in bad weather;it allows an aircraft to approach until it is 200 feet over the ground and within a half mile of the runway.

When I was flying in the North, the nearest airport with ILS was in Inuvik West, which was 475 miles - 735 km, and the next one south was Yellowknife, which was 371 miles - 589 km south of Coppermine.The only close radio beacon was Contwoyto Lake, about 285 miles southeast of Coppermine. It was put in during the Dew Line construction and was presently used for Jet travel at high altitudes for passenger traffic going over the top of the world from Europe and the returning flights on that route.It was no use to me as I could not get high enough to use that radio beacon.I was limited to being able to climb just over 12,000 feet, and those big guys were up there at 30 to 40,000 feet.

In some years past, I had flown into the Edmonton Industrial airport, and when taking off out of the airport, I was about 800 feet above ground level and just away from the airport, a short distance under full power, climbing outwhen the engine swallowed a value.With a lot of clattering and banging, the propeller became very wide right in front of me. That has to be another event to be related, as well as the total zero time on the engine and airframe that was completed after that incident.I should describe the aircraft further to help you become more familiar with my plane.The following are all the physical details of the aircraft that I owned, rebuilt, serviced, and flew all over the North and across Canada for some nine and a half years. The only inconvenience of the Aeronca aircraft is that it only has one door on the passenger's right side, so the pilot has to get into the aircraft first and into the left seat before the passenger on the right can enter.The passengers in the back seats have to get in before the front passenger can be seated.

When everything was checked out, and I was satisfied that the plane suffered no damage, we turned the aircraft into wind, and both got in. I started up the engine and was airborne in minutes. I made a circle, went past the settlement, and dipped my wings as the D.O.T. radio operator was standing outside the D.O.T. building. He waved his arms and pointed south with both arms, so I knew he had my flight plan recorded.

The Coppermine River meanders going south with 500 - 800 foot banks on the sides at random places in most of the areas we traveled, and I had been below those higher hills as we traveled above the river.It was gentle sweeping turns, and we pulled up after seeing several cow moose and calves and came to where it narrowed into a canyon area that would not be considered "moose pasture." He wanted to see if we could locate a bull moose.Before pulling up to gain elevation, I noticed that I was putting in more aerolon pressure to recover from right turns.We decided to go back and check some of the side creeks and rivers that came into the Coppermine River on both sides.When we had completed the turnaround and was straight and level, I glanced at the left wing fuel gauge, a small plastic tube that went into the cockpit from the fuel tank in the wing and was empty.I looked at the gauge in the right wing, and it was down to half.There was no way to stop the flow from either wing as both leads went to the fuel filter and then to the carburetor and motor.We had been flying about 500 feet above the river, following the sweeping bends of the river, and we were underway for about an hour and a half. When we left, I figured we had more than four hours of fuel on board. 

I immediately grabbed the radio mike and declared an emergency with the usual "MAYDAY - MAYDAY." there was no response from Yellowknife or Coppermine. I figured that I had been in the river, and when I began to climb, figuring if I got higher, there was a better chance of someone hearing my distress call if there was any other aircraft that could hear our plight.It was very apparent that at that rate of consumption or loss, we did not have sufficient fuel to make it back to Coppermine.I immediately began to climb when I got no response from my "mayday" call on the radio while low to the ground and in the river valley.I got no response from repeated calls as I climbed, and I was given my last known position. There was trouble with my fuel supply and my heading, which was more or less off to the northwest.I was also trying to get away from the rough terrain by the river and in search of a larger lake to attempt a landing on.I had sort of planned on trying to hit the trapping trail that went between Coppermine and the copper exploration camp at Chapman Lake as it went along high ground most of the way and a lot of fairly smooth ground or a larger lake to attempt to land if we ran completely out of fuel.

During the years of the Vietnam War, from 1963 to 1973, there was a great interest in discoveries of more copper for the bullets the Americans were firing.With the name Coppermine on the map, there was a great deal of interest in exploring the area.They had established an exploration camp set up at Chapman Lake about 60 - 70 miles east of Coppermine, and they had fuel for the helicopters and aircraft that were brought in from Yellowknife by going on the Great Bear Lake by barge to Port Radium, that is, a mining town on the northeastern shore of Great Bear Lake, N.W.T., by the settlement of Cameron Bay as well as the Eldorado and Echo Bay mines where the uranium was mined that was used in the Atomic Bombs that ended the conflict with Japan during World War II.With cat trains and big wheeled semi-trailers, a whole camp of trailers for prospectors and helicopter pilots, as well as a huge supply of food and fuel for helicopters and aircraft.They had a watchman there over the winter, and I had visited him about once a month by going out on the well-traveled trappers' trail by ski doo and once by my aircraft.We were concerned for his health as he was almost 80 years old and in poor health condition.The trap line trail went right past the Chapman Lake camp.

The natives living in the Coppermine area were known as the Copper Eskimos because they had found ingots of copper of all shapes and sizes and used them for their arrowheads, spears, fish spears, snow knives for making igloos, and ornamentation.It appeared as free copper on the surface of the ground in all shapes and sizes.The largest one that I saw was where a prospector had hauled it into the settlement of Holman Island up on Victoria Island, and it must have been near bronze because it had taken him almost a week to hacksaw the end of the nugget off.I believed that it must have weighed in excess of a thousand pounds.It was about six long, two feet wide, about a foot thick down the middle, and about two inches thick all around the edges.

 

Holman Island (or now Ulukhaktok) was the most northerly settlement that we Policed from Coppermine, and we would go up on the sked flight and stay for a week to ten days, depending on the scheduled flights and the amount of freight that they had for Holman Island.Then, we would have accommodation in our Patrol Cabin, and there were about 850 residents there.Like other small traditional communities in the territories, hunting, trapping, and fishing are the major sources of income, but printmaking at their co-op has taken over as the primary source of income in recent years. The two principal languages in Ulukhaktok are the Kangiryuarmiutun dialect of Inuinnaqtun, which is politically part of the Inuvialuktun group, and English.The village has the world's most northerly golf course, and I played the nine holes with pink balls with the Hudson Bay manager.Hewould take a month off every summer, go back to Scotland, and play golf every day that he was there.His whole house was carpeted with astroturf, and there were holes in every corner, with lots of lays, and the building was shifting on the permafrost.

I continued to climb until we were at 8,000 feet and continually using the radio to attempt to contact some radio station or other aircraft that might be in the air or in the area and broadcast my "Mayday" signal, but the return radio was silent with the volume turned up as high as it would go.I leveled off and reduced the rpm on the engine with the idea of extending the fuel and did some banks ever so slightly, figuring I would stretch the fuel burn and get as much fuel out of the tanks as I could.All the while looking for a larger lake to appear below us.I spotted quite a large lake a few miles ahead of us, and about that time, it got very quiet in the airplane, and the engine sputtered to a stop with the prop vertical in front of the cabin.You cannot imagine how wide a propeller is when you are at 8,000 feet and you are out of fuel.

The first words uttered by the Co-Op manager from the time I declared my first "mayday" was,"What are you going to do now?" Trying to make light of the subject, my response was, "I think we will pull over and park over on that lake ahead, and I promise to make you a cup of tea, and then we will wait until someone comes and picks us up." I directed him by saying, "What I want you to do is to keep your eye on that lake, as it will be safer to try and put down a reasonable flat surface."All the while, he continued to pull the strap on the seat belt tighter.Sherry was in the back seat, wrapped in a sleeping bag and strapped in with both seat belts.Keeping the nose down below the horizon and listening to the sound of the wind around the fuselage was the only indication that we were making good forward speed that was not excessive, and it was apparent that the glide ratio of the Aeronca was so good that we were going to make the lake without any difficulty.Keeping our noses at a point near the other end of the lake, we seemed to have no crosswind to be concerned about.I swung it around to point at a smaller lake, and from what I could determine, the air was calm, and there was no wind to worry about in which direction to land.I continued to use the radio to broadcast our plight, and now you could hear the static on the radio in the quiet cockpit, but there was no response from any radio station or aircraft.

As we got close to the lake, I realized that we were too high and would have to lose more than a thousand feet to get to the level of the hills surrounding the lake before we could attempt to go down into the valley to land on the lake.I started to do "dog bones," which is a long lateral flight back and forth with dropping the nose to pick up speed before the sharp turn, level off in the other direction, and do the same thing again within what was a good glide ratio to the lake.About half a dozen of them brought us down to the level of the top of the hills, and I headed for the edge of the lake.

At that point, I realized the hills were quite steep, and I had no free air to make any more "dog bones" to stall the approach of the shoreline.I tried one "side slip," but it was lazy coming back forward, so I did not try another of those to lose altitude.I was watching the hill out both sides of the aircraft, and I could hear from the rush of air around the cockpit that we were gaining speed, which we did not need for a short landing on skis because you have no brakes and only the resistance of the skis on the hard-packed snow.When I looked ahead to try and determine some depth perception for a round out on the lake surface and looked out in the lake a short distance, to my surprise, there was a line of black basalt island right across our path.I shoved my nose down and made contact with the lake surface, and it was a fairly rough touchdown when I rounded out with drifted snow.I looked down and saw that we were doing almost 100 mph on the airspeed indicator, which was close to our cruise speed.The black wall of rock seemed to get higher and higher as we got nearer.

When we got within about 200 feet of the rock face, I pulled the nose up, and we cleared the rocks by a good 50 feet and then shoved the nose down again, rounded out with the skis rattling along and bouncing us back in the air with every hard snow drift we came in contact with and the heavy elastic rubbers of the landing gear aggravated it.I was concerned that I would run out of airspeed and ideas at the same time, but I managed to do a three-point landing on some clear snow with no cross drifts and looked again at the airspeed indicator; we were still doing about 80 mph. The lift of the wings at that speed was taking up the weight of the aircraft, and no weight was being transferred to the skis to slow us down.On a normal "Take-Off," the plane would lift off and climb at 50 mph, with the prop wash added to the lift on the wings.When we got to the drifted area again, I had enough rudder control to turn, so we went along the drift pattern.I tried to maneuver back and forth over the drift pattern to lose some more momentum as the shoreline was coming up fairly fast, and before I lost rudder control, I managed to turn alongside the shoreline, and the aircraft finally came to a creaky stop from the noise of the skis on the hard-packed snow almost to the end of the lake, which was a good thing because the shoreline had about a ten-foot embankment.

Everything became totally quiet, and I noticed that my front-seat passenger was grunting a lot.He had pulled the seat belt so tight from repeated yanks that he was unable to get it undone and was having some difficulty in breathing.We finally managed to get his seat belt undone, and it surprised me that our daughter was still asleep in the back seat, oblivious to our predicament.

I got the emergency backpack out of from under the back seat with the idea of making him the promised cup of tea.I could not believe our poor misfortune.The locals had done us a great life-threatening disservice again and cleaned out every bit of foodstuff, leaving the few packets of "Freshy" to mix with bad-tasting water, and only two tea bags in the bottom of the pack had been missed.It was decided that he would take the high-powered rifle and go to the top of the hill to the west and see if he could spot some caribou, and while Sherry was still sleeping, I would take the .22 rifle and scout along the shoreline willows in case there were some ptarmigan or arctic hare that we could have for supper before darkness set in.I covered a good mile of the shoreline and did not see anything and, headed back to the aircraft right across the Lake.By the time my partner got back to the aircraft, the shades of darkness had caught up to us, and I would periodically turn the aircraft lights on to try to guide him home.I managed to melt enough snow to make a pot of tea from one of the two bags that were left in the emergency food pack.He had seen no tracks of any animal on his about four-mile hike into the next valley.

I slept with Sherry in the back seat with her inside the sleeping bag, and my partner slept in the other sleeping bag across the two front seats.We used the insulated engine cover and wing covers to add to the comfort of the sleeping bags in the minus 20-degree cold and slept comfortably, considering the cramped area of the cockpit.We awoke while it was still totally black outside, and the only flashlight we had was one that you had to shake to create 30 seconds of light.I melted more snow, and we drank the last tea.

It was decided that we would walk in the northwest direction, and I had two compasses in the pockets of my emergency pack.He was going to take a path about a mile apart and hoped that we would have a better chance of seeing caribou, arctic hares, or ptarmigan so we would double our chances of getting game on the separate paths for food.I left a note in the aircraft of our intention and intended direction of travel and headed out.

I carried Sherry in the backpack with the sleeping bag wrapped around her, and periodically, I would have her walk to keep her circulation going.The snow was hard-packed, and you did not even leave a track while walking in the mukluks that I was wearing.I had a roll of brightly coloured seismic tape that I would tie a piece to any little willow sprig that I came across, and if I located a few willow sprigs, I would pick a handful to take with me for markers, and that way I could look back and keep a fairly straight line of where I had traveled and leave my trail well marked.I periodically could see my hunter off a mile or two to the east with the aid of the binoculars.He came upon one of the Basalt rifts with about a 100-foot face, and I could see that he was headed my way along the edge.I happened to be at a place where you could safely make your way down, so I waited for him to come my way.

It was about 10:00 am when we heard the sound of a single-engine "Otter" aircraft off to our east.You could make it out with the binoculars, and you could hear that distinctive single-engine "Otter" sound in the stillness of the day.It was traveling south, and soon, the sound was no longer heard.About noon, we made the top of another valley and could hear the sound again of the same sort of aircraft you could make it out, possibly 15 - 20 miles east of us, and no doubt in our minds it was part of the search party looking for us, but as I watched it in the binoculars, it turned and went directly away from us until you could not hear or see it any longer.

I decided that my partner would again head northeast to give us two chances of spotting a game of some sort, and I would keep on the track that I had set out and go into a fairly deep valley with a lot ofl-rounded hills in the bottom of the valley.I was still carrying Sherry in the backpack sometimes, and she was allowed to walk up these short hills as I had the sleeping bag and the insulated engine cover as part of my load.We got to the far side of the valley and were making our way to the top of this line of a hill.When we got to the top, I stopped, and we sat down to rest on the engine cover and sleeping bag. I glassed the area for the game and spotted my partner off about a mile and a half. He was walking, all bent over, and I thought he was in some sort of physical stress.He was difficult to spot because he had the white cloth of the wing covers wrapped around him, and I could only make out the brown stock of the rifle on his back.

Scanning the horizon for the possibility of seeing the search aircraft, I spotted a small herd of about50 Caribou along the top of the hill directly in front of my bent-over hunter; it was clear that he was stalking the caribou and that was the reason he was bent over and had the wing covers over his parka to help blend into white snow background.He was almost to the ridge, so I decided to head east in his direction, as the possibility of fresh raw caribou was likely going to be on the menu.

When we dropped into the next valley, I could not see the caribou, and I could not locate my partner, as he was either over the crown of the hill or had taken the rifle off his back.The hill was fairly steep, and Sherry had played out climbing it. I was carrying her in my arms as I did not take the time to put her in the backpack. I had the sleeping bag slung on my shoulder and the white canvas insulated engine cover over the top of my head, covering both of us partly.

When I broke the top of the hill, I went to put Sherry down to walk again.Theroar of the Single engineDe HavillandOtter was right above me, no more than 50 feet, and as it went away from me, I could see that the flaps were down and skis extended; it was going to land.With my chatty companyunderneath the engine cover, I had not heard the sound of the aircraft approaching.Sherry kept saying the caribou kept running away from him, and true, they were a good mile away from my partner going into the next valley.

We caught up to the now silent aircraft, threw our baggage in, put our daughter into my wife's arms, and climbed aboard the aircraft.The local trapper was sitting in the right seat of the aircraft as a spotter in front of the pilot, and he had spotted the caribou and then spotted my partner.Half an hour later, we were on the airport runway at Coppermine and back home, no worse for wear.I asked the pilot if he would consider landing out by my airplane with some fuel, and he told me, "No way, I have done enough ‚Äòboondocking‚Äô for this trip.They found your gas cap out on the ice strip, and you can take some gas out by ski doo without risking my airplane again.‚Äù

I guess what happened was that when the aircraft was sliding sideways and hit the crack and stopped immediately,the fuel in the tank surged to the filler end of the tank and blew the gas cap off the tank. The low pressure of the air over the top of the wing provides lift for the airplane, and it siphones the fuel out of the tank as we fly along.With both fuel lines going from the tank to the filter and then up to the other tank in the right wing, the fuel continued to siphon out of that tank as well.

The next day I went by ski doo with the other member with fuel.We followed the trapper's trail out west and stopped on the top of a hill where we saw the ski marks where the "Otter" had landed and glassed the area to the south.There, to my surprise, was the line of willows emblazoned with orange seismic tape beginning within 500 feet of the trail.That was how close I was to the trapper's trail when I turned east to head for my partner on the other hill.

The aircraft had landed on the trapper's trail, which was on high ground and packed from repeated use.We simply followed our well-marked trail to the valley with the lake, and there was the aircraft sitting by the end of the lake.The pilot said they had spotted the aircraft and then the line of seismic taped flags and had followed them until the trapper spotted the caribou and then my partner.I guess with the white canvas over the top of Sherry and me, I blended in the vast white of the tundra.With her continuous chatter and the insulated engine cover completely over my head, I could not hear the aircraft approach until it passed right over us.

We put the insulated engine cover over the cowling, and with the aid of my "Poor Man's Herman Nelson," I heated up the engine and battery with the fuel cap in place with full tanks.I took off and landed back on the ice strip in Coppermine.I had a meeting with everyone present at the next theatre film show we had at the hall.I addressed the problem of the thieves that had stolen my survival food out of my aircraft twice and the danger it represented when we did not have any food for two days.I would check my survival gear before every flight before take-off, and it was never tampered with after that for the next year and a half that I was at Coppermine.
